<h3>KEY TO PRONUNCIATION</h3>

  <p><br style="clear:both" /></p>
<hr class="short" />

  <p>The method of marking pronunciations here employed is either (1) by
  marking the syllable on which the accent falls, or (2) by a simple system
  of transliteration, to which the following is the Key:&mdash;</p>

<h3>VOWELS</h3>

  <p>&#x101;, as in f<i>a</i>te, or in b<i>a</i>re.</p>

  <p>ä, as in <i>a</i>lms, Fr. <i>â</i>me, Ger. B<i>a</i>hn = á of Indian
  names.</p>

  <p>&#x12B;, as in p<i>i</i>ne, or as <i>ei</i> in Ger. m<i>ei</i>n.</p>

  <p>i, as in p<i>i</i>n, also used for the short sound corresponding to
  &#x113;, as in French and Italian words.</p>

  <p><i>eu</i>, a long sound as in Fr. j<i>eû</i>ne = Ger. long <i>ö</i>,
  as in S<i>ö</i>hne, G<i>ö</i>the (Goethe).</p>

  <p>eu, corresponding sound short or medium, as in Fr. p<i>eu</i> = Ger.
  <i>ö</i> short.</p>

  <p>&#x14D;, as in n<i>o</i>te, m<i>oa</i>n.</p>

  <p>o, as in n<i>o</i>t, s<i>o</i>ft&mdash;that is, short or medium.</p>

  M<i>ü</i>ller.</p>

  <p>oi, as in <i>oi</i>l.</p>

  <p>ou, as in p<i>ou</i>nd; or as <i>au</i> in Ger. H<i>au</i>s.</p>

<h3>CONSONANTS</h3>

  <p>Of the <i>consonants</i>, <b>b,</b> <b>d,</b> <b>f,</b> <b>h,</b>
  <b>j,</b> <b>k,</b> <b>l,</b> <b>m,</b> <b>n,</b> <b>ng,</b> <b>p,</b>
  <b>sh,</b> <b>t,</b> <b>v,</b> <b>z,</b> always have their common English
  sounds, when used to transliterate foreign words. The letter <b>c</b> is
  not used by itself in re-writing for pronunciation, <b>s</b> or <b>k</b>
  being used instead. The only consonantal symbols, therefore, that require
  explanation are the following:&mdash;</p>

  <p><b>Aasen</b> (&#x14D;&prime;zen), Ivar Andreas, Norwegian poet and
  philologist, was born in 1813 and died in 1896. He wrote miscellaneous
  poems and a drama, but he is chiefly known as the originator of the

  Norway a literary language distinct from the Danish, which has long
  served as the literary and official language of the country. This he
  attempted to do mainly by the help of the native dialects, which he
  studied thoroughly, setting forth their grammar in special works and
  embodying their vocabulary in his <i>Norsk Ordbog med Dansk
  Forklaring</i> (Norse Dictionary, with Explanations in Danish, 1873),
  supplemented by the <i>Norsk Ordbog</i> of Hans Ross (1890-2). Numbers of

  <p><b>Abbas I,</b> the <i>Great</i>, Shah or King of Persia, born in
  1557, ascended the throne in 1586, at a time when the Turks and hordes of
  Usbek Tartars had made great encroachments on the country. Having
  defeated the Usbeks, recovered the provinces overrun by them, and reduced
  a great part of Afghanistan, he made war against the Turks, and in 1605
  defeated them near Bussorah, thus getting back all the lost provinces. He
  extended his rule beyond Persia proper, and at his death in 1628 his
  dominions stretched from the Tigris to the Indus. He is looked upon by
  the Persians as their greatest sovereign.</p>

  <p><b>Abbas II, Hilmi,</b> ex-Khedive of Egypt, was born in 1874. He is

  <p><b>Abbé</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>b-&#x101;), a French word for abbot, or
  for anyone regularly wearing the clerical dress. Before the Revolution,
  all who had studied theology, either with the view of becoming ordained
  clergymen or merely of obtaining some ecclesiastical appointment or
  benefice, were generally so designated. Marked out by their special
  dress, a short, violet-coloured robe, they were seen everywhere&mdash;at
  court, the ball, the theatre, and in private families, where they acted
  sometimes as tutors and sometimes as confidential advisers. Others,
  again, adopted the literary profession or became teachers in the higher
  educational establishments.</p>

  department of the Somme, on the River Somme (which is here tidal), 108
  miles <span class="scac">N.N.W.</span> of Paris. The town is first
  mentioned in the ninth century, when it belonged to the Abbey of St.
  Riquier. It has a Gothic church (St. Vulfran) (begun in the fifteenth
  century and completed in the seventeenth), which has a magnificent west
  front in the Flamboyant style. It manufactures woollens, sail-cloth,
  chemicals, &amp;c. Pop. 20,373.</p>

  <p><b>Ab&prime;bey,</b> a monastery or religious community of the highest
  class, governed by an <i>abbot</i>, assisted generally by a prior,
  sub-prior, and other subordinate functionaries; or, in the case of a
  female community, superintended by an <i>abbess</i>. An abbey invariably
  included a church. A priory differed from an abbey only in being <!--
  Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>[4]</span>scarcely so
  extensive an establishment, and was governed by a <i>prior</i>. In the
  English conventual cathedral establishments, as Canterbury, Norwich, Ely,
  &amp;c., the archbishops or bishops held the abbot's place, the immediate
  governor of the monastery being called a prior. Some priories sprang
  originally from the more important abbeys, and remained under the
  jurisdiction of the abbots; but subsequently any real distinction between
  abbeys and priories was lost. The greater abbeys formed most complete and
  extensive establishments, including not only the church and other
  buildings devoted to the monastic life and its daily requirements, such
  as the refectory or eating-room, the dormitories or sleeping-rooms, the
  room for social intercourse, the school for novices, the scribes' cells,
  library, &amp;c., but also workshops, storehouses, mills, cattle and
  poultry sheds, dwellings for artisans, labourers, and other servants,
  infirmary, guest-house, &amp;c. Among the most famous abbeys on the
  continent of Europe were those of Cluny, Clairvaux, and Citeaux in
  France; St. Galle in Switzerland, and Fulda in Germany; the most
  noteworthy English abbeys were those of Westminster, St. Mary's of York,
  Fountains, Kirkstall, Tintern, Rievaulx, Netley; and of Scotland,
  Melrose, Paisley, and Arbroath.</p>

  Pop. 13,148.</p>

  <p><b>Ab&prime;bot</b> (from the Syriac <i>abba</i>, father), the head of
  an abbey (see <i>Abbey</i>), the lady of similar rank being called
  <i>abbess</i> (<i>abbatissa</i>). An abbess, however, was not, like the
  abbot, allowed to exercise the spiritual functions of the priesthood,
  such as preaching, confessing, &amp;c.; nor did abbesses ever succeed in
  freeing themselves from the control of their diocesan bishop. In the
  early age of monastic institutions (<i>circ.</i> <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 300-600) the monks were not priests, but simply
  laymen who retired from the world to live in common, and the abbot was
  also a layman. In the course of time the abbots were usually ordained,
  and when an abbey was directly attached to a cathedral the bishop was
  also the abbot, but the functions devolving on the head of a monastery
  were, in this case, performed by a prior. At first the abbeys were more
  remarkable for their numbers than for their magnitude, but afterwards
  many of them were large and richly endowed, and the heads of such
  establishments became personages of no small influence and power, more
  especially after the abbots succeeded (by the eleventh century) in
  freeing themselves from the jurisdiction of the bishop of their diocese.
  Hence families of the highest rank might be seen eagerly striving to
  obtain the titles of abbot and abbess for their members. The great object
  was to obtain control over the revenues of the abbeys, and for this
  purpose recourse was had to the device of holding them under a kind of
  trust, or, as it was called, <i>in commendam</i>. According to the
  original idea, the abbot <i>in commendam</i>, or 'commendator', was
  merely a temporary trustee, who drew the whole or part of the revenues
  during a vacancy, and was bound to apply them to specific purposes; but
  ultimately the commendator or lay abbot in many instances held the
  appointment for life, and was allowed to apply the whole or a large
  portion of the revenues to his own private use. Many of the abbots vied
  with the bishops and nobility in rank and dignity. In England abbots long
  sat in the House of Lords, ranking next after barons. Seventeen of them
  were present on 28th June, 1539, the last occasion when the abbots as a
  body sat in Parliament. The Reformation introduced vast changes, not <!--

  Protestant countries, where abbeys and all other monastic establishments
  were generally suppressed, but even in countries which still continued
  Roman Catholic; many sovereigns, whilst displaying their zeal for the
  Roman Catholic Church by persecuting its opponents, did not scruple to
  imitate them in the confiscation of Church property.</p>

  theological, and <i>A Brief Description of the Whole World</i>
  (1599).</p>

  Message of the Son of Man</i> (1909), <i>The Fourfold Gospel</i>
  (1913-7).</p>

  <p><b>Abd-el-Ka&prime;der,</b> an Arab chief, born in Algeria, 1807; died
  at Damascus, 1883. He was the chief opponent of the French in their <!--
  Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>[7]</span>conquest of
  Algeria, but at last surrendered to them in 1847, and was imprisoned till
  set at liberty by Napoleon III in 1852. He afterwards resided chiefly at
  Damascus, but made various journeys, and visited the Paris exhibition of
  1867. He wrote a religious philosophical work in Arabic which has been
  translated into French.</p>

  <p><b>Abde&prime;ra,</b> an ancient Greek city on the Thracian coast, the
  birthplace of Democritus (the laughing philosopher), Anaxarchus, and
  Protagoras. Its inhabitants were proverbial for stupidity.</p>

  <p><b>Abdica&prime;tion,</b> properly the voluntary, but sometimes also
  the involuntary, resignation of an office or dignity, and more especially
  that of sovereign power. Abdication does not necessarily require the
  execution of a formal deed, but may be presumed from facts and
  circumstances, as in the case of the English Revolution in 1688, when,
  after long debate, it was resolved by both Houses of Parliament that King
  James II, having endeavoured to subvert the constitution of the kingdom,
  had "<i>abdicated</i> the government, and that the throne is thereby
  vacant". Yet the sovereign of Great Britain cannot constitutionally
  abdicate without the consent of both Houses of Parliament. The principal
  abdications in recent years were: Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, 14th March,
  1917; King Constantine of Greece, 11th June, 1917; King Ferdinand of
  Bulgaria, 6th Oct., 1918; Wilhelm II of Germany, 9th Nov., 1918; Karl I
  of Austria, 13th Nov., 1918; and Marie Adelaide, Grand-Duchess of
  Luxembourg, 15th Jan., 1919.</p>

    Abdominal Regions.
  </div>

  <p><b>Abdo&prime;men,</b> in man, the belly, or lower cavity of the
  trunk, separated from the upper cavity or thorax by the diaphragm or
  midriff, and bounded below by the bones of the pelvis. It contains the
  viscera belonging to the digestive and urinary systems. What are called
  the <i>abdominal regions</i> will be understood from the accompanying
  cut, in which 1 is the <i>epigastric</i> region, 2 the <i>umbilical</i>,
  3 the <i>pubic</i>, 4 4 the right and left <i>hypochondriac</i>, 5 5 the
  right and left <i>lumbar</i>, 6 6 right and left <i>iliac</i>. The name
  is given to the corresponding portion of the body in other animals. In
  insects it comprises the whole body behind the thorax, usually consisting
  of a series of rings. See <i>Alimentary Canal</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Abdom&prime;inal Fishes</b> (Abdomin&#x101;les), a group of the
  soft-finned (or malacopterous) fishes, having fins upon the abdomen, and
  comprising the herring, pike, salmon, carp, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Abduc&prime;tion,</b> a legal term, generally applied to denote the
  offence of carrying off a female either forcibly or by fraudulent
  representations. Such a delinquency in regard to a man is styled
  <i>kidnapping</i>. There are various descriptions of abduction recognized
  in criminal jurisprudence, such as that of a child, of an heiress, or of
  a wife.</p>

  <p><b>Ab&prime;dul-Az&prime;iz,</b> Sultan of Turkey, was born in Feb.,
  1830, and succeeded his brother Abdul-Mejid, in June, 1861. He concluded
  treaties of commerce with France and England, both of which countries he
  visited in 1867. Deposed in May, 1876, he committed suicide, or more
  probably was assassinated, in June of the same year. He was succeeded by
  his son Murad V. See next article.</p>

  <p><b>Ab&prime;dul-Ham&prime;id,</b> Sultan of Turkey, younger son of
  Abdul-Mejid, born 22nd Sept., 1842, succeeded his brother Murad V, who
  was deposed on proof of his insanity in 1876. At that time Turkey, which
  was at war with Serbia, was compelled to agree to an armistice at the
  demand of Russia. The persecution and oppression of the Christian
  population of Bulgaria had roused remonstrances from other European
  countries, and a congress met at Constantinople to consider a
  constitution which the Porte had proclaimed. The conference was a
  failure, and in April, 1877, war was declared by Russia. During the
  sanguinary struggle which ensued the Turks fought with great bravery, but
  they had ultimately to sue for peace. A treaty was signed at San Stefano
  in Feb., 1878, but its provisions were modified by a congress of the
  Great Powers which met at Berlin. The island of Cyprus was ceded to
  Britain. Serbia, Rumania, and Montenegro were freed from Turkish
  suzerainty altogether; Bulgaria was left in nominal dependence; whilst
  Bosnia and Herzegovina were placed under Austrian administration. In 1881
  Thessaly was transferred to Greece; in 1885 E. Roumelia became united to
  Bulgaria. Ever since the treaty of Berlin, Abdul Hamid saw in Germany the
  future friend of Turkey. He therefore entrusted Germans with the
  reorganization of his army and finances. Subsequently there were
  massacres of Christians, a war with Greece (1897), and troubles in Crete
  and Macedonia. In April, 1909, the Sultan was deposed, and his brother,
  Rashid Effendi, proclaimed sultan as Mohammed V. Abdul Hamid died in
  captivity 10th Feb., 1918.</p>

  <p><b>Abd-ul-Lat&prime;if,</b> an Arab writer and physician, was born at
  Bagdad in 1161 and died there in 1231. He was patronized by the
  celebrated Saladin, and published an excellent description of Egypt,
  which is still extant. It was translated into English by White, Oxford,
  1800.</p>

  <p><b>Ab&prime;dul-Mej&prime;id Khan,</b> Sultan of Turkey, born in 1823,
  succeeded his father, Mahmud II, <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page8"></a>[8]</span>1st July, 1839. At the time of his accession
  Mehemet, Pasha of Egypt, had risen a second time against the Turkish
  yoke; his son Ibrahim had inflicted a severe defeat on the Turks at Nizib
  (24th June, 1839), and was advancing on Constantinople. But the
  intervention of the leading European Powers checked the designs of
  Mehemet Ali, and saved the Turkish empire. Abdul-Mejid was desirous of
  carrying out reforms, but most of them were not enforced, or caused
  bloody insurrections where attempts were made to carry them out. Owing to
  disputes between the Latin and Greek Churches regarding the rights of
  precedence and possession of the 'holy places' in Palestine, and to
  demands made by the Tsar virtually implying the right of protectorate
  over the Christian subjects of the Sultan, war broke out between Turkey

  He did useful work in connection with the chemistry of explosives
  (especially gun-cotton), the flash-point of petroleum, &amp;c.; was
  joint-inventor of cordite along with Dewar; and was also an authority on
  the manufacture of steel. He was honoured with a baronetcy, and was also

  <p><b>Abélard</b> (ab&prime;e-lärd), or <b>Abailard,</b> Peter, a
  celebrated scholastic teacher, born near Nantes, in Brittany, in 1079. He
  made extraordinary progress with his studies, and, ultimately eclipsing
  his teachers, he opened a school of scholastic philosophy near Paris,
  which attracted crowds of students from the neighbouring city. His
  success in the fiery debates which were then the fashion in the schools
  made him many enemies, among whom was Guillaume de Champeaux, his former
  teacher, chief of the cathedral school of Notre-Dame, and the most
  advanced of the Realists. Abélard succeeded his adversary in this school
  (in 1113), and under him were trained many men who afterwards rose to
  eminence, among them being the future Pope Celestin II, Peter Lombard,
  and Arnold of Brescia. While he was at the height of his popularity, and
  in his fortieth year, he fell violently in love with Heloise&mdash;then
  eighteen years of age&mdash;niece of Fulbert, a canon of Paris. They
  obtained a home in Fulbert's house under the pretext of teaching Heloise
  philosophy, and their intercourse at length became apparent. Abélard, who
  had retired to Brittany, was followed by Heloise, who there gave birth to
  a son, named Astrolabius. A private marriage took place, and Heloise
  returned to her uncle's house, but, refusing to make public her marriage
  (as likely to spoil Abélard's career), she was subjected to severe
  treatment at the hands of her uncle. To save her from this Abélard
  carried her off and placed her in a convent at Argenteuil, a proceeding
  which so incensed Fulbert that he hired ruffians who broke into Abélard's
  chamber and subjected him to a shameful mutilation. Abélard, filled with
  grief and shame, became a monk in the abbey of St. Denis, and Heloise
  took the veil. When time had somewhat moderated his grief, he resumed his
  lectures; but trouble after trouble overtook him. His theological
  writings were condemned by the Council of Soissons, and he retired to an
  oratory called the Paraclete, subsequently becoming head of the abbey of
  St. Gildas-de-Rhuys in Brittany. For a short time he again lectured at
  Paris (1136), but his doctrines once more brought persecution on him, and
  St. Bernard of Clairvaux, the most powerful man in the Church in those
  days, had him condemned by the Council of Sens and afterwards by the
  Pope. Abélard did not long survive this, dying at St. <!-- Page 9
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>[9]</span>Marcel, near
  Chalon-sur-Saône, 21st April, 1142. Heloise, who had become abbess of the
  Paraclete, had him buried there, where she herself was afterwards laid by
  his side. Their ashes were removed to Paris in 1800, and in 1817 they
  were finally deposited beneath a mausoleum in the cemetery of Père la
  Chaise. According to John of Salisbury, Abélard is credited with the
  invention of a new philosophical system, midway between Realism and
  Nominalism. In Ethics, Abélard seems to have attached importance to the
  psychological element in the action, rather than to the action itself.
  "The intention of sinning", he maintained, "is worse than the actual
  physical sin." A complete edition of his works was published by Cousin (2
  vols., Paris, 1849-59), and the letters of Abélard and Heloise have been
  often published in the original and in translations. Pope's <i>Eloisa to
  Abélard</i> is founded on them. Abélard's autobiography, entitled
  <i>Story of my Calamities</i>, is still extant.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Aberdeen&prime;,</b> a university city and royal, municipal, and
  parliamentary burgh of Scotland, capital of the county of same name,
  mainly on the north bank of the Dee at its entrance into the North Sea,
  and between this river and the Don, with a part also on the south bank of
  the Dee, while the municipal limits include the adjacent Woodside. The
  site is in places somewhat hilly. Aberdeen is one of the oldest towns in
  Scotland, and was constituted a royal burgh by William the Lion in 1179.
  The streets are generally spacious and regular, the houses built of fine
  grayish-white granite. There are many handsome public buildings, as the
  County and Municipal Buildings, Marischal College, Grammar School,
  Infirmary, Arts School, Art Gallery, Music Hall Buildings, public
  library, &amp;c. The finest street, Union Street, made in 1800, is
  carried over a valley by a granite bridge having an arch of 132 feet
  span. The small portion of the city called Old Aberdeen, long a separate
  town, consists mainly of a single street, stretching northwards to the
  River Don. Its chief buildings are King's College and St. Machar's
  Cathedral. Noteworthy features of the college buildings are the
  crown-tower and the chapel, the latter containing some very fine old
  carved woodwork. The cathedral, now used as a parish church, was
  commenced about 1357. There are several bridges over the Dee and Don.
  Over the latter is a fine old bridge (Brig o' Balgownie) of one arch,
  erected according to some accounts by Robert Bruce. There are docks 34
  acres in area, an extensive tidal harbour and basin, and a graving-dock.
  The shipping trade is extensive. The industries embrace wool, jute,
  linen, combs, soap, preserved provisions, chemicals, paper, shipbuilding,
  engineering, and especially the cutting and polishing of granite. The
  fishing industry is of great importance. The city of Aberdeen returns two
  members to Parliament. Pop. 158,969.&mdash;<i>The County of Aberdeen</i>
  forms the north-eastern portion of Scotland, and is bounded on the east
  and north by the North Sea. Area, 1,261,521 acres. It is divided into six
  districts (Mar, Formartine, Buchan, Alford, Garioch, and Strathbogie),
  and is generally hilly, there being in the south-west some of the highest
  mountains in Scotland, as Ben Macdhui (4295 feet), Cairntoul (4245),
  Cairngorm (4090), Lochnagar, &amp;c. Its most valuable mineral is
  granite, large quantities of which are exported. The principal rivers are
  the Dee and the Don, both of which enter the sea at the town of Aberdeen.
  Cereals (except wheat) and other crops succeed well, and the number of
  acres under cultivation is nearly double that of any other Scottish
  county. Great numbers of cattle are fattened and sent to London and the
  south. On the banks of the upper Dee is situated Balmoral, a favourite
  residence of Queen Victoria. Aberdeenshire and Kincardine unite in
  sending three members to Parliament. Pop. 300,980.&mdash;<i>Aberdeen
  University</i>, as now constituted, derives its origin from two different
  foundations; one, the University and King's College (Old Aberdeen),
  founded in 1494 by Bishop Elphinstone (who was bishop of Aberdeen from
  1483-1514) under the authority of a papal bull obtained at the instance
  of James IV; the other, Marischal College and University (New Aberdeen),
  founded in 1593 by Geo. Keith, Earl Marischal, by a charter ratified by
  act of Parliament. The two foundations existed as separate universities,
  both having the right of conferring degrees, till 1860, when they were
  united and incorporated into one university, the University of Aberdeen.
  Holding the funds of both colleges and dating as from the foundation of
  King's College in 1494, the university has about 300 bursaries or
  exhibitions, mostly open to public competition, and a number of money
  prizes and scholarships. The classes for arts and divinity are held in
  King's College, and those for law and medicine in Marischal College.
  There is a full teaching staff in the faculties of arts, medicine,
  science, and divinity, and two professors in that of law. There are in
  all 25 professors and some 900 matriculated students. The constitution of
  the university is similar to that of Edinburgh and the other Scottish
  universities. The library contains over 80,000 volumes. The university
  unites with those of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St. Andrews in sending three
  members to Parliament.</p>

  <p><b>Aberdeen&prime;,</b> George Hamilton Gordon, Earl of, British
  statesman, born 28th Jan., 1784, died 14th Dec., 1860. He began his
  diplomatic life in 1801 as attaché to Lord Cornwallis's embassy to
  France, which resulted in the signing of the treaty of Amiens. In 1806 he
  entered Parliament as a Scottish representative peer, and in 1813 was
  entrusted with a successful mission to Austria for the purpose of
  inducing the emperor to join the coalition of sovereigns against
  Bonaparte. In 1814 he was created a British peer, and in 1828 he became
  foreign secretary in the Duke of Wellington's administration. During the
  short premiership of Sir Robert Peel in 1834-5 he acted as colonial
  secretary, and when Sir Robert again became premier in 1841 he took
  office as Secretary for Foreign Affairs. He was a warm supporter of <!--
  Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>[11]</span>Catholic
  Emancipation, and endeavoured, though without result, to bring in a
  compromise bill in 1846, during the struggle which divided the
  Established Church of Scotland. Quitting office with his chief in 1846,
  he came, on the death of Peel in 1850, to be regarded as the leader of
  the Conservative free-trade party. On the Derby ministry failing to
  maintain its place, Lord Aberdeen returned to office in the end of 1852
  as head of a coalition ministry. The principal event which marked his
  administration was the Crimean war; but the bad management of this
  irritated the country, and the ministry resigned in 1855. This event
  marks the close of Lord Aberdeen's public career. From his travels and
  his acquaintance with Greece and its antiquities he was called by Byron
  "the travelled thane, Athenian Aberdeen".</p>

  <p><b>Abracadab&prime;ra,</b> a word of Eastern origin used in
  incantations. When written on paper so as to form a triangle, the first
  line containing the word in full, the one below it omitting the last
  letter, and so on each time until only one letter remained, and worn as
  an amulet, it was supposed to be an antidote against certain
  diseases.</p>

  <p><b>Abraham,</b> Heights or Plains of. See <i>Quebec</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Abraham à Santa Clara,</b> a German pulpit orator, whose real name
  was Ulrich Megerle, born in 1644. As a preacher he acquired so great a
  reputation that, in 1669, he was appointed court-preacher in Vienna,
  where he died in 1709. His sermons are full of homely, grotesque humour,
  often of coarse wit, and impartial severity towards all classes of
  society. His principal work and masterpiece is <i>Judas, the
  Archknave</i> (4 vols.), 1686-95.</p>

  <p><b>Abrahamites,</b> 1, A sect of Syrian Deists of the ninth century,
  whose doctrines were allied to those of the Paulicians.&mdash;2, A sect
  of Bohemian Deists of the late eighteenth century, who professed to be
  followers of John Huss and claimed that they followed the religion of
  Abraham before his circumcision. Believing in one God, they rejected the
  Trinity, and accepted nothing of the Bible except the Ten Commandments
  and the Lord's Prayer. Refusing to join either the Jewish or Christian
  folds, they were excluded from the edict of toleration promulgated by the
  Emperor Joseph II, and expelled to Transylvania in 1783. Some were
  martyred, others became Roman Catholics.</p>

  <p><b>Abraham-men,</b> originally a set of vagabonds who had been
  discharged from Bethlehem Hospital, London; but as many assumed, without
  right, the badge worn by them, the term came to signify an impostor who
  travelled about the country seeking alms, under the pretence of
  lunacy.</p>

  <p><b>Abrax&prime;as</b> (or <b>Abrasax</b>) <b>Stones,</b> the name
  given to stones or gems found in Syria, Egypt, and elsewhere, cut into
  almost every variety of shape, but generally having a human trunk and
  arms, with a cock's head, two serpents' tails for the legs, &amp;c., and
  the mystico-theosophical word Abraxas or Abrasax in Greek characters
  engraved upon them. Eventually they came to be used as charms and
  amulets. Basilides (<span class="scac">A.D.</span> 130) and other
  gnostics gave the name of Abraxas to Almighty God, the Supreme Deity,
  since the numerical value of its letters in Greek gave the sum of 365,
  and they believed that 365 orders of spirits emanated from God. Not all
  abraxas stones, however, are of gnostic origin, just as the name of
  abraxas cannot be applied to all gnostic stones. Cf. King: <i>The
  Gnostics and their Remains</i>, London, 1887.</p>

  <p><b>Abrin,</b> or <b>Abrine,</b> a poisonous substance, being the
  active principle in the seeds of <i>Abrus precatorius</i> (see
  <i>Abrus</i>). A minute quantity introduced into the blood is fatal to
  many animals, but it is employed in ailments of the eyes, and as a remedy
  for lupus and certain skin diseases.</p>

  <p><b>Abroga&prime;tion,</b> the repealing of a law by a competent
  authority.</p>

  <p><b>Abrolhos</b> (a-brole&prime;-yoce) a group of rocky islands 50
  miles off the east coast of Brazil, the largest of which is Santa

  Australia.</p>

  <p><b>Abro&prime;ma,</b> a genus of small trees, natives of India, Java,

  <p><b>Ab&prime;rus,</b> a genus of papilionaceous plants, order
  Leguminosæ, one species of which, <i>Abrus precatorius</i>, a delicate
  twining shrub, a native of the East Indies, and found also in tropical
  parts of Africa and America, has round brilliant scarlet seeds, used to
  make necklaces and rosaries. Its root is sweetish and mucilaginous, and
  is used as a substitute for liquorice <i>(Indian liquorice</i>). The
  seeds yield a strong poison.</p>

  <p><b>Abruzzi</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>-bru<span class="x1"><span

  the Adriatic, between Umbria and the Marches on the north, and Apulia on
  the south. It is united with Molise to form a <i>compartimento</i>,
  comprising the four provinces of Aquila degli Abruzzi, Campobasso,
  Chicti, and Teramo. The sea-coast of about 80 miles does not possess a
  single harbour. The interior is rugged and mountainous, being traversed
  throughout by the Apennines. The lower parts consist of fertile plains
  and valleys, yielding corn, wine, oil, almonds, saffron, &amp;c.; area,
  6387 sq. miles. Pop. 1,480,748.</p>

  <p><b>Ab&prime;salon,</b> or <b>Axel,</b> a Danish prelate, statesman,
  and warrior, born in 1128, died 1201. He became the intimate friend and
  counsellor of his sovereign Waldemar I, who appointed him Archbishop of
  Lund. He cleared the sea of the Slavonic pirates who had long infested
  it, secured the independence of the kingdom by defeating a powerful fleet
  of the Emperor Barbarossa, and built the castle of Axelborg, the nucleus
  of Copenhagen. He ultimately became Primate of Denmark and Sweden.
  Turning his thoughts to literature he caused the <i>History of
  Denmark</i> to <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page14"></a>[14]</span>be drawn up by Saxo Grammaticus and Svend
  Aagesen.</p>

  <p><b>Ab&prime;scess,</b> any collection of purulent matter or pus formed
  in some tissue or organ of the body, and confined within some
  circumscribed area, of varying size, but always painful and often
  dangerous.</p>

  <p><b>Absenteeism,</b> a term applied to landlords who absent themselves
  from their estates and live and spend their money elsewhere; in its more
  extended meaning it refers to all those whose fixed residence is outside
  their own country but who derive their income from sources within it. The
  social, economic, political, and moral evils resulting from such a system
  are considerable and hurtful to the interests of a region, the absentee
  being apt to lose his interest in things and persons and the public
  welfare generally. Some economists, however, have adduced arguments in
  favour of it, as it may sometimes be for the good of the community that a
  rich and luxurious landlord should be absent from his estate.</p>

  <p>The absenteeism of the Irish nobility, which became worse after the
  Union with Great Britain and the transfer of Parliament from Dublin to
  London, has been a constant source of mischief, whilst France before the
  Revolution, Russia under the Tsars Alexander I and Nicholas I, and
  Hungary in the eighteenth century suffered greatly from the practice. The
  first statute concerning absentees was passed in the English Parliament
  in 1379, and in 1729 a tax was levied on all moneys paid out of
  Ireland.</p>

  <p><b>Ab&prime;sinth,</b> French <i>Absinthe</i> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>b-san<span class="x1"><span
  class="x3">&#x2D9;</span></span>t), a liqueur consisting of an alcoholic
  solution strongly flavoured with an extract of several sorts of wormwood,
  oil of anise, &amp;c. When taken habitually, or in excess, its effects
  are very pernicious. A favourite drink of the Parisians, it was
  suppressed entirely throughout France by a law passed on 12th Feb.,
  1915.</p>

  <p><b>Ab&prime;solute,</b> in a general sense, loosed or freed from all
  limitations or conditions. In politics, an <i>absolute</i> monarchy is
  that form of government in which the ruler is unlimited or uncontrolled
  by constitutional checks. In modern metaphysics <i>the Absolute</i>
  represents the unconditioned, infinite, and self-existent.</p>

  <p><b>Absolu&prime;tion,</b> remission of a penitent's sins in the name
  of God. It is commonly maintained that down to the twelfth century the
  priests used only what is called the <i>precatory</i> formula, "May God
  or Christ absolve thee", which is still the form in the Greek Church;
  whereas the Roman Catholic uses the expression "I absolve thee", thus
  regarding the forgiveness of sins as in the power of the priest (the
  <i>indicative</i> form). This theory of absolution was confirmed by the
  Council of Trent. The passages of Scripture on which the Roman Catholic
  Church relies in laying down its doctrine of absolution are such as
  <i>Mat.</i> xvi. 19, xviii. 18; <i>John</i>, xx. 23. Among Protestants
  absolution properly means a sentence by which a person who stands
  excommunicated is released from that punishment.</p>

  <p><b>Absolutism,</b> a system of government in which the supreme power
  is vested in a ruler not controlled or limited by any constitution or
  laws. It has prevailed in Oriental countries, including Japan, until the
  latter part of the nineteenth century. There are now no absolute
  monarchies in Europe.</p>

  <p><b>Absor&prime;bents,</b> the system of minute vessels by which the
  nutritive elements of food and other matters are carried into the
  circulation of vertebrate animals. The vessels consist of two different
  sets, called respectively <i>lacteals</i> and <i>lymphatics</i>. The
  former arise from the digestive tract, the latter from the tissues
  generally, both joining a common trunk which ultimately enters the
  blood-vessel system. Absorbents in medicine are substances such as chalk,
  charcoal, &amp;c., that absorb or suck up excessive secretion of fluid or
  gas.</p>

  <p><b>Absorp&prime;tion,</b> in physiology, one of the vital functions by
  which the materials of nutrition and growth are absorbed and conveyed to
  the organs of plants and animals. In vertebrate animals this is done by
  the lymphatics and lacteals, in plants chiefly by the roots. See
  <i>Absorbents</i>.</p>

  <p>In physics, <i>absorption of colour</i> is the phenomenon observed
  when certain colours are retained or prevented from passing through
  transparent bodies; thus pieces of coloured glass are almost opaque to
  some parts of the spectrum, while allowing other colours to pass through
  freely. In chemistry absorption is the taking up of a gas by a liquid, or
  by a porous solid.</p>

  <p><b>Ab&prime;stinence</b>. See <i>Fasting, Temperance</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Abstrac&prime;tion,</b> the operation of the mind by which it
  disregards part of what is presented to its observation in order to
  concentrate its attention on the remainder. It is the foundation of the
  operation of generalization, by which we arrive at general conceptions.
  In order, for example, to form the conception of a horse, we disregard
  the colour and other peculiarities of the particular horses observed by
  us, and attend only to those qualities which all horses have in common.
  In rising to the conception of an animal we disregard still more
  qualities, and attend only to those which all animals have in common with
  one another.</p>

  <p><b>Abu</b> (a-bö&prime;), a granitic mountain of India in Sirohi
  State, Rajputána, rising precipitously from the surrounding plains, its
  top forming a picturesque and varied tract 14 miles long and 2 to 4
  broad; highest point 5653 ft. It is a <!-- Page 15 --><span

  Europeans, and is the site of two most beautiful Jain temples, built in
  1031 and 1200.</p>

  <p><b>Abu-Bekr,</b> or <b>Father of the Virgin,</b> born 570 died 634,
  the father-in-law and first successor of Mahomet. His right to the
  succession was unsuccessfully contested by Ali, Mahomet's son-in-law, and
  a schism took place, which divided the Mahommedans into the two great
  sects of Sunnites and Shiites, the former maintaining the validity of
  Abu-Bekr's and the latter that of Ali's claim.</p>

  <p><b>Abukir&prime;</b>. See <i>Aboukir</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Abu Klea,</b> a group of wells, surrounded by steep, black
  mountains, about 120 miles from Khartoum, in the Sudan, where, on the
  17th Jan., 1885, Sir Herbert Stewart, with 1500 men, defeated the Mahdi's
  troops numbering 10,000.</p>

  <p><b>Abulfara&prime;gius,</b> Gregory, a distinguished scholar, a Jew by
  birth (hence the name of <i>Barhebræus</i>, often given him), author of
  numerous works in Arabic and Syriac, was born in Armenia in 1226, died in
  1286. About 1264 he was consecrated Bishop of Gubas; he was afterwards
  translated to Aleppo and was appointed primate of the Jacobite
  Christians. His principal work is a <i>History of the World</i> from the
  Creation to his own day, written in Syriac, with an abridged version in
  Arabic, entitled <i>The Abridged History of the Dynasties</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Abul&prime;feda,</b> Arab writer, Prince of Hamah, in Syria, of the
  same family as Saladin, famous as an historian and geographer, was born
  at Damascus 1273, died 1331. Amid the cares of government he devoted
  himself with zeal to study, drew the learned around him, and rendered his
  power and wealth subservient to the cause of science. His most important
  works are his <i>History of the Human Race</i> (the portion from the
  birth of Mahomet to his own time being valuable), and his geography
  called <i>The True Situation of Countries</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Abunda,</b> a Bantu race of Angola, living on the coastlands and on
  the terraces rising towards the interior, and divided into 'highlanders'

  <p><b>Abu&prime;tilon,</b> a genus of plants, order Malvaceæ, sometimes
  called Indian mallows, found in the East Indies, Australia, Brazil,
  Siberia, &amp;c. Several of them yield a valuable hemp-like fibre, as
  <i>A. indicum</i> and <i>A. Avicennæ</i>. The latter, now a troublesome
  weed in the Middle United States, has been recommended for cultivation,
  and is sometimes called American jute.</p>

  <p><b>Aby&prime;dos,</b> 1, an ancient city of Asia Minor, on the
  Hellespont, at the narrowest part of the strait, opposite Sestos.
  Leander, say ancient writers, swam nightly from Abydos to Sestos to see
  his loved Hero&mdash;a feat in swimming accomplished also by Lord
  Byron.&mdash;2, an ancient city of Upper Egypt (Egyptian Abotu), about 6
  miles west of the Nile, now represented only by ruins of temples, tombs,
  &amp;c. It was celebrated as the burial-place of the god Osiris, and its
  oldest temple was dedicated to him. Here, in 1818, was discovered the
  famous <i>Abydos Tablet</i>, now in the British Museum, and containing a
  list of the predecessors of Rameses the Great, which was supplemented by
  the discovery of a similar historical tablet in 1864. The tomb of Osiris
  was discovered in 1898 by Amélinau. Cf. Flinders Petrie, <i>The Royal
  Tombs of the Earliest Dynasties</i> (2 vols.), London, 1900-9.</p>

  <p><b>Abyssin&prime;ia</b> (Ar. <i>Habesha</i>), a country of Eastern

  15° <span class="scac">N.</span> and long. 35° to 42° <span
  class="scac">E.</span>, having the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan on the <span
  class="scac">W.</span>, British E. Africa on the <span
  class="scac">S.</span>, and on the <span class="scac">S.E.</span> and
  <span class="scac">E.</span> Somali-land and Eritrea (Italian Red Sea
  coast); area, 350,000 sq. miles. Pop. over 8,000,000. The country is now
  divided into 9 provinces, the principal being Harrar, Tigré, Amhara or
  Gondar. Each province is governed by a ras, or prince, but Ras Michael,
  the governor of Wollo and father of the deposed negus, Lij Yasu, was
  crowned king on 1st June, 1914. Abyssinia proper is an elevated region,
  with a general slope to the north-west. The more marked physical features
  are a vast series of tablelands, of various and often of great
  elevations, and numerous masses or ranges of high and rugged mountains,
  dispersed over the surface in apparently the wildest confusion. Along the
  deep and tremendous ravines that divide the plateaux rush innumerable
  streams, which impart extraordinary fertility to the plains and valleys
  below. The mountains in various parts of the country rise to 12,000 and
  13,000 feet, while some of the peaks are over 15,000 feet (Ras Dashan
  being 15,160), and are always covered with snow. The principal rivers
  belong to the Nile basin, the chief being the impetuous Tacazzé ('the
  Terrible') in the north, and the Abai in the south, the latter being
  really the upper portion of the Blue Nile. The principal lake is Lake
  Tzana or Dembea (from which issues the Abai), upwards of 6000 feet above
  the sea, having a length of about 45 and a breadth of 35 miles. Round
  this lake lies a fertile plain, deservedly called the granary of the
  country.&mdash;According to elevation there are several zones <!-- Page
  16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>[16]</span>of
  vegetation. Within the lowest belt, which reaches an elevation of 4800
  feet, cotton, wild indigo, acacias, ebony, baobabs, sugar-canes, coffee
  trees, date palms, &amp;c., flourish, while the larger animals are lions,
  panthers, elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, jackals, hyenas,
  bears, numerous antelopes, monkeys, and crocodiles. The middle zone,
  rising to 9000 feet, produces the grains, grasses, and fruits of southern
  Europe, the orange, vine, peach, apricot, the bamboo, sycamore tree,
  &amp;c. The principal grains are millet, barley, wheat, maize, and teff,
  the latter a small seed, a favourite bread-stuff of the Abyssinians. Two,
  and in some places three, crops are obtained in one year. All the
  domestic animals of Europe, except swine, are known. There is a variety
  of ox with immense horns. The highest zone, reaching to 14,000 feet, has
  but little wood, and generally scanty vegetation, the hardier corn-plants
  only being grown; but oxen, goats, and long-woolled sheep find abundant
  pasture.&mdash;The climate is as various as the surface, but as a whole
  is temperate and agreeable; in some of the valleys the heat is often
  excessive, while on the mountains the weather is cold. In certain of the
  lower districts malaria prevails.&mdash;The chief mineral products are
  sulphur, copper, coal, and salt, the last-named serving to some extent as
  money. Iron is very abundant and is manufactured into knives, hatchets,
  and spears. There has been a great intermixture of races in Abyssinia.
  Those who may be considered the Abyssinians proper seem to have a
  blood-relationship with the Bedouin Arabs. Their complexion varies from
  very dark through different shades of brown and copper to olive, and they
  are usually well built. Other races are the black Gallas from the south;
  the Falashas, who claim descent from Abraham and retain many Jewish
  characteristics; the Agows, Gongas, &amp;c. The great majority of the
  people profess Christianity, belonging, like the Copts, to the sect of
  the Monophysites. The head of the church is called the Abuna ('our
  father'), and is consecrated by the Coptic patriarch of Alexandria. Geez
  or Ethiopian is the language of their sacred books: it has long ago
  ceased to be spoken. The chief spoken language is the Amharic; in it some
  books have been published. Mohammedanism appears to be gaining ground in
  Abyssinia. A corrupt form of Judaism is professed by the
  Falashas.&mdash;The bulk of the people are devoted to agriculture and
  cattle-breeding. The trade and manufactures are of small importance. A
  good deal of common cotton cloth and some finer woven fabrics are
  produced. Leather is prepared to some extent, silver filagree-work is
  produced, and there are manufactures of common articles of iron and
  brass, pottery, &amp;c. Trade is carried on through Zeila and Djibouti
  (French Ethiopian Railway was completed in 1915) on the Gulf of Aden, and
  Massowa on the Red Sea (Italian), exports being hides, coffee, wax, gum,
  ivory, &amp;c., imports textile fabrics, &amp;c. The Abyssinians were
  converted to Christianity in the fourth century, by some missionaries
  from Alexandria. In the sixth century the power of the sovereigns of
  their kingdom, which was generally known as Ethiopia, had attained its
  height; but before another had expired the Arabs had invaded the country,
  and obtained a footing. For several centuries subsequently the kingdom
  continued in a distracted state, being now torn by internal commotions
  and now invaded by external enemies (Mahommedans and Gallas). To protect
  himself from the latter the Emperor of Abyssinia applied, about the
  middle of the sixteenth century, to the King of Portugal for assistance,
  promising, at the same time, implicit submission to the Pope. The
  solicited aid was sent, and the empire saved. The Roman Catholic priests
  endeavoured to induce the emperor and his family to renounce the tenets
  and rites of the Coptic Church, and to adopt those of Rome. This attempt,
  however, was resisted by the ecclesiastics and the people, and ended,
  after a long struggle, in the expulsion of the Catholic priests about
  1630. The kingdom gradually fell into a state of anarchy, and was broken
  up into several independent States. An attempt to revive the power of the
  ancient kingdom of Ethiopia was made by King Theodore about the middle of
  the last century. He introduced European artisans, and went to work
  wisely in many ways, but his cruelty and tyranny counteracted his politic
  measures. In consequence of a slight, real or fancied, which he had
  received at the hands of the British Government, he threw Consul Cameron
  and a number of other British subjects into prison, in 1863, and refused
  to give them up. To effect their release an army of nearly 12,000 men,
  under Sir Robert (afterwards Lord) Napier, was dispatched from Bombay in
  1867. The force landed at Zoulla on the Red Sea, and marching up the
  country came within sight of the hill-fortress of Magdala in April, 1868.
  After being defeated in a battle, Theodore delivered up the captives and
  shut himself up in Magdala, which was taken by storm on the 13th April,
  Theodore being found among the slain. After the withdrawal of the
  British, fighting immediately began among the chiefs of the different
  provinces, but at last the country was divided between Kasa, who secured
  the northern and larger portion (Tigré and Amhara) and assumed the name
  of King Johannes, and Menelek, who gained possession of Shoa. Latterly
  Johannes made himself supreme and in 1881 assumed the title of emperor
  (<i>negus <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page17"></a>[17]</span>negusti</i>&mdash;king of kings), having
  under him the Kings of Shoa and Gojam. Debra Tabor, about 30 miles east
  of Lake Dembea, was his chief residence. During the troubles in Abyssinia
  the Egyptians annexed Massowa and the region adjacent, Abyssinia being
  thus shut out from the sea. Afterwards the Italians gained and still hold
  Massowa and the Red Sea littoral (Eritrea). Johannes fell at Metemmeh in
  1889, whilst fighting against the Mahdists, and was succeeded by Menelek
  II. In 1916 Lij Yasu, who succeeded Menelek II in 1913, was deposed and
  Waizeru Zauditu (born 1876) became empress.&mdash;<span

  </div>

  <p><b>Aca&prime;cia,</b> a genus of plants, nat. ord. Leguminosæ,
  sub-order Mimoseæ, consisting of trees or shrubs with compound pinnate
  leaves and small leaflets, growing in Africa, Arabia, the East Indies,
  Australia, &amp;c. The flowers, usually small, are arranged in spikes or
  globular heads at the axils of the leaves near the extremity of the
  branches. The corolla is bell- or funnel-shaped; stamens are numerous;
  the fruit is a dry unjointed pod. Several of the species yield gum-arabic
  and other gums; some having astringent barks and pods, used in tanning.
  <i>A. Catechu</i>, an Indian species, yields the valuable astringent
  called catechu; <i>A. dealb&#x101;ta</i>, the wattle tree of Australia,
  from 15 to 30 feet in height, is the most beautiful and useful of the
  species found there. Its bark contains a large percentage of tannin, and
  is exported in large quantities. Some species yield valuable timber; some
  are cultivated for the beauty of their flowers.</p>

  <p><b>Acad&prime;emy,</b> an association for the promotion of literature,
  science, or art; established sometimes by Government, sometimes by the
  voluntary union of private individuals. The name Academy was first
  applied to the philosophical school of Plato, from the place where he
  used to teach, a grove or garden at Athens which was said to have
  belonged originally to the hero Acad&#x113;mus. The home of Academies as
  associations of learned men (not institutes for instruction), was
  Hellenized Egypt and afterwards Italy of the Renaissance. The flourishing
  Academies at Florence, Naples, and Rome became the models of academies in
  other countries. Academies devote themselves either to the cultivation of
  science generally or to the promotion of a particular branch of study, as
  antiquities, language, and the fine arts. The most celebrated
  institutions bearing the name of academies, and designed for the
  encouragement of science, antiquities, and language respectively, are the
  French Académie des Sciences (founded by Colbert in 1666), Académie des
  Inscriptions (founded by Colbert in 1663), and Académie Française
  (founded by Richelieu in 1635), all of which are now merged in the
  National Institute. The most celebrated of the academies instituted for
  the improvement of language is the Italian Accademia della Crusca, or
  Furfuratorum (now the Florentine Academy), formed in 1582, and chiefly
  celebrated for the compilation of an excellent dictionary of the Italian
  language (<i>Vocabulario della Crusca</i>, Venice, 1612), and for the
  publication of several carefully-prepared editions of ancient Italian
  poets. The (Imperial) Academy of Science of St. Petersburg was projected
  by Peter the Great and established by Catherine I in 1725. The Academy of
  Science in Berlin was founded by Frederick I in 1700. It was opened in
  1711 and had Leibnitz as its first president. In Britain the name of
  academy, in the more dignified sense of the term, is confined almost
  exclusively to certain institutions for the promotion of the fine arts,
  such as the Royal Academy of Arts and the Royal Scottish Academy. The
  Royal Academy of Arts (usually called simply the Royal Academy) was
  founded in London in 1768, "for the purpose of cultivating and improving
  the arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture". The number of
  academicians is now limited to forty-two, among whom are two engravers.
  There are also thirty associates, from whom the academicians are elected.
  Of the associates five are engravers. Any person who is possessed of <!--

  student and receive instruction gratis, and prizes are annually bestowed
  on meritorious students. The annual exhibition of the Academy is open to
  all artists whose works show sufficient merit. The Royal Scottish Academy
  of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture was founded in 1826 and
  incorporated in 1838. It consists of thirty academicians and twenty
  associates. The Royal Hibernian Academy at Dublin was incorporated in
  1823 and reorganized in 1861. It consists of thirty members and ten
  associates. A British Academy for the Promotion of Historical,
  Philosophical, and Philological Studies was incorporated in 1902. (See
  <i>British Academy</i>.) In the United States, the American Academy of
  Arts and Sciences at Boston was founded in 1780, and since then various
  other societies of similar character and name have been instituted, as
  the New York Academy of Sciences, the Chicago Academy of Science,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Aca&prime;dia</b> (Fr. <i>Acadie</i>), the name formerly given to
  Nova Scotia. It received its first colonists from France in 1604, being
  then a possession of that country, but it passed to Britain, by the Peace
  of Utrecht, in 1713. In 1756, 18,000 of the French inhabitants were
  forcibly removed from their homes on account of their hostility to the
  British, an incident on which is based Longfellow's <i>Evangeline</i>.
  Many Acadians afterwards wandered back to their old homes, and their
  descendants are at present supposed to number 270,000, 100,000 of them
  living in French Canada.</p>

  <p><b>Acale&prime;pha</b> (Gr. <i>akal&#x113;ph&#x113;</i>, a nettle,

  <p><b>Acanth&prime;us,</b> a genus of herbaceous plants or shrubs, order
  Acanthaceæ, mostly tropical, two species of which, <i>A. mollis</i> and
  <i>A. spin&#x14D;sus</i> (the bear's-breech or brankursine), are
  characterized by large white flowers and deeply-indented shining leaves.
  They are favourite ornamental plants in British gardens.&mdash;In
  architecture the name is given to a kind of foliage decoration said to
  have been suggested by this plant, and much employed in Greek, Roman, and
  later styles.</p>

  <p><b>Acapul&prime;co,</b> a seaport of Mexico, on the Pacific, with a
  capacious, well-sheltered harbour; a coaling station for steamers, but
  with no great trade. Pop. 5950.</p>

  <p><b>Acar&prime;ida,</b> a division of the Arachnida, including the
  mites, ticks, and water-mites. See <i>Mite</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Acarna&prime;nia,</b> the most westerly portion of Northern Greece,
  together with Ætolia now forming a nomarchy with a pop. of 188,597. The
  Acarnanians of ancient times were behind the other Greeks in
  civilization, living by robbery and piracy.</p>

  <p><b>Ac&prime;arus,</b> the genus to which the mite belongs.</p>

  <p><b>Acca&prime;dians</b> (Akkad), the primitive inhabitants of Northern
  Babylonia (Akkad), who had descended from the mountainous region of Elam
  on the east, and to whom the Assyrians ascribed the origin of Chaldean
  civilization and writing. This race is believed to have belonged to the
  Turanian family, or to have been at any rate non-Semitic. What is known
  of them has been learned from the cuneiform inscriptions. See
  <i>Babylonia</i> and <i>Summerians</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Accelera&prime;tion</b> is the rate of change of the velocity of a
  body under the action of a force. A body falling from a height is one of
  the most common instances of acceleration.&mdash;<i>Acceleration of the
  Moon</i>, the increase of the moon's mean angular velocity about the
  earth, the moon now moving rather faster than in ancient times. This
  phenomenon has not been fully explained, but it is known to be partly
  owing to the slow process of diminution which the eccentricity of the
  earth's orbit is undergoing, and from which there results a slight
  diminution of the sun's influence on the moon's motions.&mdash;<i>Diurnal
  acceleration of the fixed stars</i>, the apparent greater diurnal motion
  <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>[19]</span>of
  the stars than of the sun, arising from the fact that the sun's apparent
  yearly motion takes place in a direction contrary to that of his apparent
  daily motion. The stars thus seem each day to anticipate the sun by
  nearly 3 minutes 56 seconds of mean time.</p>

  <p><b>Ac&prime;cent,</b> a term used in several senses. In English it
  commonly denotes superior stress or force of voice upon certain syllables
  of words, which distinguishes them from the other syllables. Many English
  words, as <i>as&prime;pi-ra&Prime;tion</i>, have two accents, a secondary
  and primary, the latter being the fuller or stronger. Some words, as
  <i>in-com&prime;pre-hen&prime;si-bil&Prime;i-ty</i>, have two secondary
  or subordinate accents. When the full accent falls on a vowel, that vowel
  has its long sound, as in <i>vo&prime;cal</i>; but when it falls on a
  consonant, the preceding vowel is short, as in <i>hab&prime;it</i>. This
  kind of accent alone regulates English verse, as contrasted with Latin or
  Greek verse, in which the metre depended on <i>quantity</i> or length of
  syllables. In books on elocution three marks or accents are generally
  made use of, the first or <i>acute</i> (&acute;) showing when the voice
  is to be raised, the second or <i>grave</i> (&#x60;), when it is to be
  depressed, and the third or <i>circumflex</i> (&#x2C6;) when the vowel is
  to be uttered with an undulating sound. In some languages there is no
  such distinct accent as in English (or German), and this seems to be now
  the case with French.&mdash;In music, accent is the stress or emphasis
  laid upon certain notes of a bar. The first note of a bar has the
  strongest accent, but weaker accents are given to the first notes of
  subordinate parts of the bars, as to the third, fifth, and seventh in a
  bar of eight quavers.</p>

  <p><b>Accen&prime;tor</b> (<i>Accentor modul&#x101;ris</i>), or <b>Hedge
  Accentor,</b> a British bird of the warbler family. See <i>Hedge
  Warbler</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Accep&prime;tance,</b> in law, the act by which a person binds
  himself to pay a bill of exchange drawn upon him. (See <i>Bill</i>.) No
  acceptance is valid unless made in writing on the bill, but an acceptance
  may be either absolute or conditional, that is, stipulating some
  alteration in the amount or date of payment, or some condition to be
  fulfilled previous to payment.</p>

  <p><b>Ac&prime;cessary,</b> or <b>Ac&prime;cessory,</b> in law, a person
  guilty of an offence by connivance or participation, either before or
  after the act committed, as by command, advice, concealment, &amp;c. An
  accessary <i>before the fact</i> is one who procures or counsels another
  to commit a crime, and is not present at its commission; an accessary
  <i>after the fact</i> is one who, knowing a felony to have been
  committed, gives assistance of any kind to the felon so as to hinder him
  from being apprehended, tried, or suffering punishment. An accessary
  before the fact may be tried and punished in all respects as if he were
  the principal. In high treason, all who participate are regarded as
  principals.</p>

  <p><b>Acciden&prime;tals,</b> notes introduced in the course of a piece
  of music in a different key from that in which the passage where they
  occur is principally written. They are represented by the sign of a
  sharp, flat, or natural immediately before the note which is to be raised
  or lowered.</p>

  <p><b>Accipitres</b> (ak-sip&prime;i-tr&#x113;z), the name given by
  Linnæus and Cuvier to the rapacious birds now usually called Raptores
  (q.v.).</p>

  <p><b>Acclimatiza&prime;tion,</b> the process of accustoming plants or
  animals to live and propagate in a climate different from that to which
  they are indigenous, or the change which the constitution of an animal or
  plant undergoes under new climatic conditions, in the direction of
  adaptation to those conditions. The systematic study of acclimatization
  has only been entered upon in very recent times, and the little progress
  that has been made in it has been more in the direction of formulating
  anticipative, if not arbitrary hypotheses, than of actual discovery and
  acquisition of facts. The best-known society founded, for the purpose of
  naturalizing animals and plants, is the Société d'Acclimatation in Paris.
  It opened the Jardin d'Acclimatation in 1860. See <i>Tropical
  Hygiene</i>. The term is sometimes applied to the case of animals or
  plants taking readily to a new country with a climate and other
  circumstances similar to what they have left, such as European animals
  and plants in America and New Zealand: but this is more properly
  <i>naturalization</i> than acclimatization.&mdash;In agriculture the word
  is used with reference to stock, principally sheep, 'acclimatized' to a
  particular area, a special allowance being made by the landlord on
  transference of the farm and stock in respect of the acclimatization of
  the sheep. The value assigned to the advantages resulting from
  acclimatization of stocks varies considerably. In Argyllshire, for
  instance, Dumbartonshire, and the western portion of Perthshire the rates
  are high, while in the south of Scotland and the north of England they
  are much lower.</p>

  <p><b>Accolade</b> (ak-o-l&#x101;d&prime;; Fr., from Lat. <i>ad</i>, to,
  <i>collum</i>, the neck), the ceremony used in conferring knighthood,
  anciently consisting either in the embrace given by the person who
  conferred the honour of knighthood or in a light blow on the neck or the
  cheek, latterly consisting in the ceremony of striking the candidate with
  a naked sword.</p>

  <p><b>Accol&prime;ti,</b> Benedetto, an Italian lawyer, born at Arezzo in
  Tuscany in 1415, died at Florence in 1466. He was secretary to the
  Florentine republic, 1459, and author of a work on the Crusades which is
  said to have furnished Tasso with matter for his <i>Jerusalem
  Delivered</i>. <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><b>Accommoda&prime;tion Bill,</b> a bill of exchange drawn and
  accepted to raise money on, and not given, like a genuine bill of
  exchange, in payment of a debt, but merely intended to accommodate the
  drawer: colloquially called a <i>wind bill</i> and a <i>kite</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Accommoda&prime;tion Ladder,</b> a light ladder hung over the side
  of a ship at the gangway to facilitate ascending from, or descending to,
  boats.</p>

  <p><b>Accom&prime;paniment,</b> in music, is that part of music which
  serves for the support of the principal melody.</p>

  <p><b>Accor&prime;dion,</b> a keyed musical wind-instrument similar to
  the concertina, being in the form of a small box, containing a number of
  metallic reeds fixed at one of their extremities, the sides of the box
  forming a folding apparatus which acts as a bellows to supply the wind,
  and thus set the reeds in vibration, and produce the notes both of melody
  and harmony. The accordion was invented by Damian of Vienna in 1829.</p>

  <p><b>Accountant,</b> a person whose chief business is with accounts and
  the drawing up of financial statements and balance-sheets. An accountant
  is an important official in banks, railways, and certain other
  institutions, and many persons carry on the business of accountant as a
  distinct profession, auditing the books of merchants, joint-stock
  companies, &amp;c. There are several bodies of accountants in the United
  Kingdom incorporated by royal charter, and hence specially distinguished
  as 'chartered accountants' (C.A.). Since 1919 women are admitted as
  members of the Society of Incorporated Accountants.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Ac&prime;cra,</b> a British settlement in Africa, in a swampy
  situation, capital of Gold Coast, about 75 miles east of Cape Coast
  Castle. Exports gold-dust, ivory, gums, palm-oil; imports cottons,
  cutlery, &amp;c. Pop. 20,000.</p>

  <p><b>Ac&prime;crington,</b> a municipal borough of England, Lancashire,
  5 miles east of Blackburn, with large cotton factories, print-works and
  bleaching-greens, and coal-mines. Pop. 43,610. Accrington was created a
  parliamentary borough in 1918.</p>

  <p><b>Accu&prime;mulator,</b> a name applied to a kind of electric
  battery by means of which electric energy can be stored and rendered
  portable. In the usual form each battery forms a cylindrical leaden
  vessel, containing alternate sheets of metallic lead and minium wrapped
  in felt and rolled into a spiral wetted with acidulated water. On being
  charged with electricity the energy may be preserved till required for
  use.</p>

  <p><b>Accu&prime;sative Case,</b> in Latin and some other languages, the
  term applied to the case which designates the object to which the action
  of any verb is immediately directed, corresponding, generally speaking,
  to the <i>objective</i> in English.</p>

  <p><b>Ace,</b> in aviation the name 'ace' is given to a flying-man who
  has distinguished himself by bringing down a large number (sometimes
  given as ten) of enemy machines. The word is used colloquially, and was
  borrowed from the French Air Force during the European War.</p>

  <p><b>Aceph&prime;ala,</b> in zoology, the headless Mollusca or those

  <p><b>Acetab&prime;ulum,</b> an anatomical term applied to any cup-like
  cavity, as that of a bone to receive the protuberant end of another bone,
  the cavity, for instance, that receives the end of the thigh-bone.</p>

  <p><b>Acetates</b> (as&prime;e-t&#x101;ts), salts of acetic acid. The
  acetates of most commercial or manufacturing importance are those of
  aluminium and iron, which are used in calico-printing; of copper, which
  as verdigris is used as a colour; and of lead, best known as sugar of
  lead. The acetates of potassium, sodium, and ammonium, of iron, zinc, and
  lead, and the acetate of morphia, are employed in medicine.</p>

  <p><b>Acet&prime;ic Acid,</b> an acid produced by the oxidation of common
  alcohol, and of many other organic substances. Pure acetic acid has a
  very sour taste and pungent smell, burns the skin, and is poisonous. From
  freezing at ordinary temperatures (58° or 59°) it is known as <i>glacial
  acetic acid</i>. Vinegar is simply dilute acetic acid. Acetic acid is
  largely used in the arts, in medicine, and for domestic purposes. See
  <i>Vinegar</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Acet&prime;ic Ethers,</b> or <b>Acetic Esters,</b> acetates of
  alcohol radicals. The common ester&mdash;ethyl acetate&mdash;is a
  volatile colourless liquid, manufactured by distilling a mixture of
  alcohol, oil of vitriol, and acetic acid, and used for flavouring
  purposes.</p>

  <p><b>Acetone</b> (as&prime;), a constituent of ordinary wood spirit, a
  colourless volatile liquid used as a solvent, the simplest of the
  <i>ketones</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Acet&prime;ylene,</b> C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, is a substance
  composed of two elements, carbon and hydrogen, and belonging to a class
  of compounds known as hydrocarbons. It is formed in the incomplete
  combustion of many hydrocarbons and also of coal-gas, and may be produced
  in a variety of ways, but is now made almost entirely from calcium
  carbide. Acetylene has been known for a long time, but only since 1870
  has it been produced in any quantity. After the development of the
  electric furnace it was found that calcium oxide, <!-- Page 21 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>[21]</span>quicklime, heated with
  carbon to the high temperature possible in such a furnace, is transformed
  into calcium carbide, and this compound reacts with water, generating
  acetylene. A great deal of heat is developed on adding water to calcium
  carbide, so that care has to be taken in generating acetylene. Various
  devices are in use for bringing the two substances in contact slowly, and
  for keeping the temperature low. When carbon and hydrogen combine to form
  acetylene a large amount of heat is used up, so that much heat is evolved
  when acetylene decomposes again, and once decomposition starts sufficient
  heat is developed to decompose the whole volume of gas.</p>

  <p>Acetylene is a colourless gas slightly soluble in water and very
  sparingly soluble in brine. When pure it has little or no odour, but as
  ordinarily prepared it has a strong unpleasant odour due to traces of
  impurities such as sulphuretted hydrogen, phosphine, &amp;c. The gas can
  be liquefied easily, and in the liquid state is highly explosive. It
  burns with an exceedingly sooty flame, but if it is allowed to pass
  through a very small orifice the carbon liberated becomes incandescent
  and acetylene burns with an intense white flame. It is largely used as an
  illuminant and for the production of great heat. As an illuminant the gas
  is produced in specially-constructed generators. It is led through iron
  pipes and burned from an acetylene burner, or it may be used with special
  types of incandescent mantles. Acetylene readily combines with copper and
  with silver to form metallic acetylides which are very explosive, hence
  pipes through which acetylene is passing must not be made of brass or
  copper. Acetylene mixed with air and brought in contact with an ignited
  body explodes even more violently than a mixture of air and coal-gas.</p>

  <p>Large quantities of acetylene are generated and stored for
  oxy-acetylene welding. Acetylene, burning in oxygen, gives an intensely
  hot flame (about 2000°-3000° C.), sufficiently hot to melt iron. Although
  liquid acetylene is unstable, and even the gas, under slight pressure, is
  also unstable, it may be transported safely if dissolved in acetone.
  Acetone dissolves a large volume of acetylene, and this solution is quite
  stable and may be stored in iron cylinders and used for various purposes.
  If it is to be stored it must be carefully purified from phosphine, which
  is apt to cause sudden decomposition. Recently, numerous patents have
  been taken out for the preparation of compounds such as acetaldehyde,
  acetic acid, acetic anhydride, &amp;c., using acetylene as
  starting-point, so that many substances may be prepared from acetylene
  just as many substances may be prepared from benzene.</p>

  <p><b>Achæans</b> (a-k&#x113;&prime;anz), one of the four races into
  which the ancient Greeks were divided. In early times they inhabited a
  part of Northern Greece and of the Peloponnesus. They are represented by
  Homer as a brave and warlike people, and so distinguished were they that
  he usually calls the Greeks in general Achæans. Afterwards they settled
  in the district of the Peloponnesus, called after them Achaia, and
  forming a narrow belt of coast on the south side of the Gulf of Corinth.
  From very early times a confederacy or league existed among the twelve
  towns of this region. After the death of Alexander the Great it was
  broken up, but was revived again, 280 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and
  from this time grew in power till it spread over the whole Peloponnesus.
  It was finally dissolved by the Romans, 147 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, and after this the whole of Greece, except
  Thessaly, was called Achaia or Achæa. Achaia with Elis now forms a
  nomarchy of the kingdom of Greece. Pop. 254,728. Cf. Freeman, <i>History

  native State of Sumatra, with a capital of the same name, in the
  north-western extremity of the island, now nominally under Dutch
  administration. Though largely mountainous, it has also undulating tracts
  and low fertile plains. By treaty with Britain the Dutch were prevented
  from extending their territory in Sumatra by conquest; but this obstacle
  being removed, in 1871 they proceeded to occupy Acheen. It was not till
  1879, however, after a great waste of blood and treasure, that they
  obtained a general recognition of their authority. But they have not been
  able to establish it firmly, and have had <!-- Page 22 --><span

  determined risings, sometimes costing them losses both in men and guns.
  In the seventeenth century Acheen was a powerful State, and carried on
  hostilities successfully against the Portuguese, but its influence
  decreased with the increase of the Dutch power. The principal exports are
  rice and pepper. Area, 20,471 sq. miles; pop. 789,664.</p>

  <p><b>Achilles</b> (a-kil&prime;&#x113;z), a Greek legendary hero, the
  chief character in Homer's <i>Iliad</i>. His father was Peleus, ruler of
  Phthia in Thessaly, his mother the sea-goddess Thetis. When only six
  years of age he was able to overcome lions and bears. His guardian,
  Cheiron the Centaur, having declared that Troy could not be taken without
  his aid, his mother, fearing for his safety, disguised him as a girl, and
  introduced him among the daughters of Lycomedes of Scyros. Her desire for
  his safety made her also try to make him invulnerable when a child by
  anointing him with ambrosia, and again by dipping him in the River Styx,
  from which he came out proof against wounds, all but the heel, by which
  she held him. His place of concealment was discovered by Odysseus
  (Ulysses), and he promised his assistance to the Greeks against Troy.
  Accompanied by his close friend, Patroclus, he joined the expedition with
  a body of followers (Myrmidons) in fifty ships, and occupied nine years
  in raids upon the towns neighbouring to Troy, after which the siege
  proper commenced. On being deprived of his prize, the maiden Briseïs, by
  Agamemnon, he refused to take any further part in the war, and disaster
  attended the Greeks. Patroclus now persuaded Achilles to allow him to
  lead the Myrmidons to battle dressed in his armour, and he having been
  slain by Hector, Achilles vowed revenge on the Trojans, and forgot his
  anger against the Greeks. He attacked the Trojans and drove them back to
  their walls, slaying them in great numbers, chased Hector, who fled
  before him three times round the walls of Troy, slew him, and dragged his
  body at his chariot-wheels, but afterwards gave it up to Priam, who came
  in person to beg for it. He then performed the funeral rites of
  Patroclus, with which the <i>Iliad</i> closes. He was killed in a battle
  at the Scæan Gate of Troy by an arrow from the bow of Paris which struck
  his vulnerable heel. In discussions on the origin of the Homeric poems
  the term <i>Achilleid</i> is often applied to those books (i, viii, and
  xi-xxii) of the <i>Iliad</i> in which Achilles is prominent, and which
  some suppose to have formed the original nucleus of the poem. See
  <i>Iphigenia</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Achilles' Tendon,</b> or <b>Tendon of Achilles,</b> <!-- Page 23
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"></a>[23]</span>the strong
  tendon which connects the muscles of the calf with the heel, and which
  may be easily felt with the hand. The origin of the name will be
  understood from the above article.</p>

  <p><b>Achilles Tatius</b> (a-kil&prime;&#x113;z t&#x101;&prime;shi-us), a
  Greek romance writer of the fifth century <span class="scac">A.D.</span>,
  belonging to Alexandria; wrote a love story in 8 books called
  <i>Leucipp&#x113; and Cleitophon</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Achimenes</b> (a-kim&prime;e-n&#x113;z), a genus of tropical
  American plants, with scaly underground tubers, nat. ord. Gesneraceæ, now
  cultivated in European greenhouses on account of their white, blue, and
  red flowers.</p>

  <p><b>Achlamydeous</b> (ak-la-mid&prime;i-us), in botany, wanting the
  floral envelopes, that is, having neither calyx nor corolla, as the

  <p><b>Achor</b> (&#x101;&prime;kor), a disease of infants, in which the
  head, the face, and often the neck and breast become incrusted with thin,
  yellowish or greenish scabs, arising from minute, whitish pustules, which
  discharge a viscid fluid.</p>

  <p><b>Achromat&prime;ic</b> (Gr. <i>a</i>, priv., and <i>chr&#x14D;ma,
  chr&#x14D;matos</i>, colour), in optics, transmitting colourless light,
  that is, not decomposed into the primary colours, though having passed
  through a refracting medium. A single convex lens does not give an image
  free from the prismatic colours, because the rays of different colour
  making up white light are not equally refrangible, and thus do not all
  come to a focus together, the violet, for instance, being nearest the
  lens, the red farthest off. If such a lens of crown-glass, however, is
  combined with a concave lens of flint-glass&mdash;the curvatures of both
  being properly adjusted&mdash;as the two materials have somewhat
  different optical properties, the latter will neutralize the chromatic
  aberration of the former, and a satisfactory image will be produced.
  Telescopes, microscopes, &amp;c., in which the glasses are thus composed
  are called <i>achromatic</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Acid</b> (Lat. <i>acidus</i>, sour), a name applied to a number of
  compounds, having more or less the qualities of vinegar (itself a diluted
  form of acetic acid). Their general properties are sour taste, the power
  of changing vegetable blues into reds, of evolving hydrogen in presence
  of magnesium, of decomposing chalk with effervescence, and of being in
  various degrees neutralized by alkalies. An acid has been defined as a
  compound of hydrogen, the whole or a part of which is replaceable by a
  metal when this is presented in the form of a hydroxide; being
  <i>monobasic</i>, <i>dibasic</i>, or <i>tribasic</i>, according to the
  number of replaceable hydrogen atoms in a molecule. See
  <i>Chemistry</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Acierage</b> (&#x101;&prime;s&#x113;-&#x117;r-&#x101;j), (Fr.
  <i>acier</i>, steel), a process by which an engraved copper-plate or an
  electrotype from an engraved plate of steel or copper has a film of iron
  deposited over its surface by electricity in order to protect the
  engraving from wear in printing. By this means an electrotype of a fine
  engraving, which, if printed directly from the copper, would not yield
  500 good impressions, can be made to yield 3000 or more; and when the
  film of iron becomes so worn as to reveal any part of the copper, it may
  be removed and a fresh coating deposited so that 20,000 good impressions
  may be got.</p>

  <p><b>Acousimeter,</b> or <b>Acoumeter</b> (Gr. <i>akouein</i>, to hear,
  and <i>metron</i>, measure), an instrument used to determine the
  acuteness of hearing. It consists of a small bar which gives a uniform
  sound when struck by a hammer.</p>

  <p><b>Acoustics</b> (a-kou&prime;stiks), the science of sound. It deals
  with the production of sound, its propagation and velocity in various
  media; the reflection, refraction, and interference of sound waves; the
  properties of musical notes; and the general phenomena of such vibrations
  of elastic bodies as affect the organ of hearing.</p>

  <p>In order that a sound may be heard, it is necessary that an
  uninterrupted series of particles of elastic matter should extend from
  the sounding body to our ear. Sound is propagated by a longitudinal
  wave-motion in the medium (gaseous, liquid, or solid), that is, the
  particles oscillate along the line in which the wave is travelling,
  giving rise to regular series of condensations and rarefactions.</p>

  <p>The velocity of sound varies directly as the square root of the
  elasticity, and inversely as the square root of the density, of the
  medium in which it is propagated. The velocity of sound in air at 0° C.
  is 330.6 metres per second, or 1085 feet per second; in water 1.49
  kilometres per second, or 0.926 mile per second; in copper 5.01
  kilometres per second, or 3.12 miles per second.</p>

  <p>The intensity of sound varies inversely as the square of the distance
  from the sounding body. Recently sound-ranging instruments have been
  produced by means of which the position of a gun can be determined.</p>

  <p>A note produced by a musical instrument consists of a
  <i>fundamental</i> of a certain frequency, together with a number of
  <i>overtones</i> of various higher frequencies and much smaller
  amplitude. The <i>timbre</i> of a note depends on the overtones present,
  the <i>loudness</i> depends on the amplitude of the vibrations, and the
  <i>pitch</i> depends on the frequency. The musical scale consists of
  eight notes, C D E F G A B C, whose frequencies are in the proportion of
  the numbers 24, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40, 45 and 48. The interval between two
  notes is the ratio of the frequency of the higher note to the frequency
  of the lower note. In order that the intervals may be the same in all
  keys, a tempered scale is used in music. (See Table, p. 25.)</p>

  <p><b>Acre</b> (&#x101;&prime;k&#x117;r) (ancient <b>Accho</b> and
  <b>Ptolemais</b>), a seaport of Syria, in Northern Palestine, on the Bay
  of Acre, early a place of great strength and importance. Taken from the
  Saracens under Saladin in 1191 by Richard I of England and Philip of
  France; bravely defended by the Turks, assisted by Sir Sidney Smith, in
  1799 against Napoleon; in 1832, taken by Ibrahim Pasha; in 1840,
  bombarded by a British, Austrian, and Turkish fleet, and restored to the
  Sultan of Turkey. The town was occupied by British troops under General
  Allenby in September, 1918. Pop. 10,000.</p>

  <p><b>Acri</b> (&#x101;&prime;kr&#x113;), a town of S. Italy, province of
  Cosenza. Pop. 4000.</p>

  <p><b>Ac&prime;rita</b> (Gr. <i>akritos</i>, undistinguishable,
  doubtful), a name sometimes given to the animals otherwise called
  Protozoa.</p>

  <p><b>Acroceph&prime;ali,</b> tribes of men distinguished by pyramidal or
  high skulls.</p>

  <p><b>Acrocerau&prime;nia</b> (thunder-smitten peaks) (now <b>Cape
  Glossa</b> or <b>Linguetta</b>), a promontory of Western Greece, in
  Epirus, running into the Adriatic.</p>

  <p><b>Acrocorin&prime;thus,</b> a steep rock in Greece, nearly 1900 feet
  high, overhanging ancient Corinth, and on which stood the acropolis or
  citadel, the sacred fountain of Pir&#x113;n&#x113; being also here. This
  natural fortress has proved itself of importance in the modern history of
  Greece.</p>

  <p><b>Ac&prime;rogens</b> (-jenz), lit. summit-growers, a term applied to
  the ferns, mosses, and lichens (cryptogams), as growing by extension
  upwards, in contradistinction to endogens and exogens.</p>

  <p><b>Ac&prime;rolith,</b> an early form of Greek statuary in which the
  head, hands, and feet only were of stone, the trunk of the figure being
  of wood draped or gilded.</p>

  <p><b>Acrop&prime;olis</b> (Gr. <i>akros</i>, high, and <i>polis</i>, a
  city), the citadel or chief place of a Grecian city, usually on an
  eminence commanding the town. That of Athens contained some of the finest
  buildings in the world, such as the Parthenon, Erechth&#x113;um,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Acros&prime;tic,</b> a poem of which the first or last, or certain
  other, letters of the line, taken in order, form some name, motto, or
  sentence. A poem of which both first and last letters are thus arranged
  is called a double acrostic. In Hebrew poetry, the term is given to a
  poem of which the initial letters of the lines or stanzas were made to
  run over the letters of the alphabet in their order, as in <i>Psalm</i>
  cxix.&mdash;Acrostics have been much used in complimentary verses, the
  initial letters giving the name of the person eulogized. They were very
  popular among French poets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In
  modern times Edgar Allen Poe has written quite remarkable acrostic
  verses.</p>

  <p><b>Act,</b> in special senses: (1) In dramatic poetry, one of the
  principal divisions of a drama, in which a definite and coherent portion
  of the plot is represented; generally subdivided into smaller portions
  called <i>scenes</i>. The Greek dramas were not divided into acts. The
  dictum that a drama should consist of five acts was first formally laid
  down by Horace, and is generally adhered to by modern dramatists in
  tragedy. In comedy, especially since the time of Molière, more freedom is
  allowed, and a division into two or three acts is common.&mdash;(2)
  Something formally done by a legislative or judicial body; a statute or
  law passed.&mdash;(3) In universities, a thesis maintained in public by a
  candidate for a degree. See <i>Act of God</i>, <i>of Parliament</i>,
  <i>of Settlement</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Acta Diur&prime;na</b> (Lat., proceedings of the day), a daily
  Roman newspaper which appeared under both the republic and the
  empire.</p>

  <p><b>Actæ&prime;a.</b> See <i>Baneberry</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Actæ&prime;on,</b> in Greek mythology, a great hunter, turned into
  a stag by Art&#x115;mis (Diana) for looking on her when she was bathing,
  and torn to pieces by his own dogs.</p>

  <p><b>Acta Erudito&prime;rum</b> (Lat., acts of the learned), the first
  literary journal that appeared in Germany (1682-1782). It was started by
  Otto Mencke, after the model of the <i>Journal des Savants</i>. Among the
  contributors, the most distinguished was Leibnitz.</p>

  <p><b>Acta Sanctorum</b> (Lat., acts of the saints), a name applied to
  all collections of accounts of ancient martyrs and saints, both of the
  Greek and Roman Churches, more particularly to the valuable collection
  begun by John Bolland, a Jesuit of Antwerp, in 1643, and which, being
  continued by other divines of the same order (<i>Bollandists</i>), now
  extends to sixty volumes, the lives following each other in the order of
  the calendar.</p>

  <p><b>Actin&prime;ia,</b> the genus of animals to which the typical
  sea-anemones belong. See <i>Sea-anemone</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ac&prime;tinism,</b> the property of those rays of light which
  produce chemical changes, as in photography, in contradistinction to the
  light rays and heat rays. The actinic property or force begins among the
  green rays, is strongest in the violet rays, and extends a long way
  beyond the visible spectrum.</p>

  <p><b>Actinium,</b> an element or elementary substance obtained in minute
  quantities in connection with the study of radioactivity. It was
  discovered by Debierne in 1899. In 1902 Giesel discovered another
  substance which he called <i>emanium</i>, and which was considered to be
  identical with <i>actinium</i>. Marckwald, however, came to the
  conclusion that these two substances are not identical but closely
  related to each other. See <i>Radium</i>, <i>Chemistry</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Actin&prime;olite,</b> a mineral nearly allied to hornblende.</p>

  <p><b>Actinom&prime;eter,</b> an instrument for measuring the intensity
  of the sun's actinic rays. See <i>Actinism</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Actinozo&prime;a</b> (lit. ray-animals), a class of animals
  belonging to the sub-kingdom C&oelig;lenterata, and including
  sea-anemones, corals, &amp;c., all having rayed tentacles round the
  mouth.</p>

  <p><b>Action,</b> the mode of seeking redress at law for any wrong,
  injury, or deprivation. Actions are divided into civil and criminal, the
  former again being divided into real, personal, and mixed.</p>

  <p><b>Ac&prime;tium</b> (now <b>La Punta</b>), a promontory on <!-- Page
  27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>[27]</span>the western
  coast of Northern Greece, not far from the entrance of the Ambracian Gulf
  (Gulf of Arta), memorable on account of the naval victory gained here by
  Octavianus (afterwards the Emperor Augustus) over Antony and Cleopatra,
  2nd Sept., 31 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, in sight of their armies
  encamped on the opposite shores of the Ambracian Gulf. Soon after the
  beginning of the battle Cleopatra escaped with sixty Egyptian ships, and
  Antony basely followed her, and fled with her to Egypt. The deserted
  fleet was not overcome without making a brave resistance. Antony's land
  forces soon went over to the enemy, and the Roman world fell to
  Octavianus. In 1538 a victory was gained at Actium by the Turks over the
  Spanish and Venetian fleets.</p>

  <p><b>Act of God,</b> a legal term defined as "a direct, violent, sudden,
  and irresistible act of nature, which could not, by any reasonable cause,
  have been foreseen or resisted". No one can be legally called upon to
  make good loss so arising.</p>

  <p><b>Act of Parliament,</b> a law or statute proceeding from the
  Parliament of the United Kingdom passed in both houses, and having
  received the royal assent. Before it is passed it is a <i>Bill</i> and
  not an Act. Acts are either public or private, the former affecting the
  whole community, the latter only special persons and private concerns.
  The whole body of public Acts constitutes the <i>statute law</i>. An Act
  of Parliament can only be altered or repealed by the authority of
  Parliament. Acts are usually cited in this way, "13 and 14 Vict. c. (or
  chap.) 21", which means the 21st Act in succession passed in year
  13th-14th of the queen's reign (that is, 1850). Short titles, such as
  "the Merchant Shipping Act, 1854", are also used. Up to the time of
  Edward I Acts of Parliament were in Latin; then French was introduced,
  and for some time was exclusively employed. It was not till Henry VII's
  reign that all Acts were in English.</p>

  <p><b>Act of Settlement,</b> an Act passed by the English Parliament in
  1700, by which the succession to the throne of the three kingdoms, in the
  event of King William and Princess (afterwards Queen) Anne dying without
  issue, was settled on the Princess Sophia, electress of Hanover, and the
  heirs of her body, being Protestants. The Princess Sophia was the
  youngest daughter of Elizabeth, Queen of Bohemia, daughter of James I. By
  this act George I, son of the Princess Sophia, succeeded to the crown on
  the death of Queen Anne.&mdash;Another Act of Settlement was that by
  which, under Cromwell's government, a new allotment was made of almost
  all landed property in Ireland, in 1652.</p>

  <p><b>Act of Toleration,</b> an Act of Parliament Passed in 1689, by
  which Protestant dissenters from the Church of England, on condition of
  their taking the oaths of supremacy and allegiance, and repudiating the
  doctrine of transubstantiation, were relieved from the restrictions under
  which they had formerly lain with regard to the exercise of their
  religion according to their own forms.</p>

  <p><b>Act of Uniformity,</b> an English Act passed in 1662, enjoining
  upon all ministers to use the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i> on pain of
  forfeiture of their livings. See <i>Nonconformity</i>.</p>

    Quilted Acton of the fifteenth century
  </div>

  <p><b>Acton,</b> a kind of padded or quilted vest or tunic formerly worn
  under a coat of mail to save the body from bruises, or used by itself as
  a defensive garment. Jackets of leather or other material plated with
  mail were also so called. <i>Gambeson</i> was an equivalent term.</p>

  <p><b>Acton,</b> a name of various places in England, one of them a
  western suburb of London, pop. (1921), 61,314. Since 1918 Acton gives its
  name to a parliamentary division of Middlesex, returning one member to
  Parliament.</p>

  <p><b>Acton,</b> John Emerich Edward Dalberg, first Baron Acton, born
  1834, died 1902, was son of Richard Acton (seventh baronet) and the
  daughter of the Duc de Dalberg, afterwards wife of Earl Granville, Mr.
  Gladstone's colleague. As a Roman Catholic he was educated at Oscott, and
  afterwards on the Continent, partly under Döllinger, and acquired a
  special taste for and profound knowledge of history. He conducted the
  <i>Home and Foreign Review</i> from 1862 to 1864, and, in doing so,
  showed himself a strong opponent of ultramontane pretensions. He next
  edited the <i>North British Review</i>, which under him was rather
  overweighted with learning, and soon came to an end. In 1869 he was
  raised to the peerage. He strongly opposed the papal-infallibility
  movement, and took the side of Mr. Gladstone in his attacks on
  Vaticanism. In 1895 he accepted the professorship of modern history at
  Cambridge, delivered lectures, and planned and undertook the editorship
  of the great work on modern history, <i>The Cambridge Modern History</i>,
  comprising a series of contributions by various scholars, and issued by
  the university press. Except essays, letters, or articles for
  periodicals, he himself wrote little. Since his death have been
  published: <i>Lectures in Modern History</i> (1906); <i>The History of
  Freedom and other Essays</i> (1907); <i>Lectures on the French
  Revolution</i> (1910). His library of 60,000 volumes he left to Mr. (now
  Lord) Morley, who handed it over to the University of Cambridge. <!--

  <p><b>Actor,</b> one who represents some part or character on the stage.
  Actresses were unknown to the Greeks and Romans in the earliest times,
  men or boys always performing the female parts. They appeared under the
  Roman empire, however. Charles II first encouraged the public appearance
  of actresses in England; in Shakespeare's time there were none. See

  <p><b>Acts of the Apostles,</b> fifth of the books of the New Testament,
  written in Greek and assigned to the author of the gospel of St. Luke.
  Its date is probably <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 63 or 64. It embraces
  a period of about thirty years, beginning immediately after the
  resurrection, and extending to the second year of the imprisonment of St.
  Paul in Rome. Very little information is given regarding any of the
  apostles, excepting St. Peter and St. Paul, and the accounts of them are
  far from being complete. It describes the gathering of the infant Church;
  the fulfilment of the promise of Christ to his apostles in the descent of
  the Holy Ghost; the choice of Matthias in the place of Judas, the
  betrayer; the testimony of the apostles to the resurrection of Jesus in
  their discourses; their preaching in Jerusalem and in Judea, and
  afterwards to the Gentiles; the conversion of Paul, his preaching in Asia
  Minor, Greece, and Italy, his miracles and labours.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Acupress&prime;ure,</b> a means of arresting bleeding from a cut
  artery introduced by Sir James Simpson in 1859, and consisting in
  compressing the artery above the orifice, that is, on the side nearest
  the heart, with the middle of a needle (Lat. <i>acus</i>, a needle)
  introduced through the tissues.</p>

  <p><b>Acupunc&prime;ture,</b> a surgical operation, consisting in the
  insertion of needles into certain parts of the body for alleviating pain,
  or for the cure of different species of rheumatism, neuralgia, eye
  diseases, &amp;c. It is easily performed, gives little pain, causes
  neither bleeding nor inflammation, and seems at times of surprising
  efficacy.</p>

  <p><b>Adagio</b> (It. a<span class="x1"><span

  <p><b>Adâl&prime;,</b> a country in Africa, east of Abyssinia and
  north-westward of Tajurrah Bay, inhabited by a dark-brown race of the
  same name, a tribe of the Danakils, Mahommedans in religion; towns Aussa
  and Tajurrah. Part of the coast here is held by the French.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;albert of Prague,</b> called the apostle of the Prussians,
  son of a Bohemian nobleman named Slavnik, born about 939. His real name
  was Voitech, but he assumed the name of the Archbishop Adalbert, under
  whom he studied at Magdeburg. He was appointed Bishop of Prague in 983,
  laboured in vain among the heathenish Bohemians, resolved to convert the
  pagans of Prussia, but was murdered in the attempt (997).

  possessed over their passions. Practices similar to those of the Adamites
  arose several times in later ages. See <i>Beghards</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Adam&prime;nan,</b> St., born in Ireland about 624, was elected
  abbot of Iona in 679, and died there about 703 or 704. He is best known
  from his <i>Life of St. Columba</i>, valuable as throwing light on the
  early ecclesiastical history of Scotland. (There are editions by Reeves,
  1857; reissued with English translation 1874; and by Fowler, 1895.) His
  feast is celebrated on 23rd Sept.</p>

  <p><b>Adams,</b> Charles Francis, American litterateur and statesman, was
  a son of John Quincy Adams, and was born in 1807. His boyhood was spent
  in Europe, partly in England; but he finished his education at Harvard,
  and afterwards studied law. After serving some years in the Massachusetts
  legislature he was sent to Congress in 1859. In 1861 Lincoln sent him to
  England as American minister, and here he remained for seven years,
  performing the arduous duties of his office with the utmost tact and
  ability. Between 1874 and 1877 he edited a complete edition of his
  grandfather's works in 12 vols. He was one of the arbitrators on the
  <i>Alabama</i> claims. Died in 1886.</p>

  <p><b>Adams,</b> John, second president of the United States, was born at
  Braintree (now Quincy), Massachusetts, 19th Oct., 1735. He was educated
  at Harvard University, and adopted the law as a profession. His attention
  was directed to politics by the question as to the right of the English
  Parliament to tax the colonies, and in 1765 he published some essays
  strongly opposed to the claims of the mother country. As a member of the
  new American congress in 1774, 1775, and 1776 he was strenuous in his
  opposition to the home Government, and in organizing the various
  departments of the colonial Government. On 13th May, 1776, he seconded
  the motion for a declaration of independence proposed by Lee of Virginia,
  and was appointed a member of committee to draw it up. The declaration
  was actually drawn up by Jefferson, but it was Adams who fought it
  through Congress. In 1778 he went to France on a special mission, but
  soon came back and again returned, and for nine years resided abroad as
  representative of his country in France, Holland, and England. After
  taking part in the peace negotiations he was appointed, in 1785, the
  first ambassador of the United States to the Court of St. James. He was
  recalled in 1788, and the following year elected vice-president of the
  republic under Washington. In 1792 he was re-elected vice-president, and
  at the following election in 1797 he became president in succession to
  Washington. The commonwealth was then divided into two parties, the
  Federalists, who favoured aristocratic and were suspected of monarchic
  views, and the Republicans. Adams adhered to the former party, with which
  his views of government had always been in accordance, but the real
  leader of the party was Hamilton, with whom Adams did not agree, and who
  tried to prevent his election. His term of office proved a stormy one,
  which broke up and dissolved the Federalist party. His re-election in
  1801 was again opposed by the efforts of Hamilton, which ended in
  effecting the return of the Republican candidate Jefferson. Thus it
  happened that when Adams retired from office his influence and popularity
  with both parties were at an end, and he sunk at once into the obscurity
  of private life. He had the consolation, however, of living to see his
  son president. He died 4th July, 1826, the fiftieth anniversary of the
  declaration of independence, and on the same day as Jefferson. His works
  have been ably edited by his grandson Charles Francis Adams.</p>

  <p><b>Adams,</b> John Couch, English astronomer, born 1819, died 1892,
  studied at Cambridge, and was senior wrangler in 1843. His investigations
  into the irregularities in the motion of the planet Uranus led him to the
  conclusion that they must be caused by another more distant planet, and
  the results of his labours were communicated in September and October,
  1845, to Professor Challis and Airy the Astronomer Royal. The French
  astronomer Leverrier had by this time been engaged in the same line of
  research, and had come to substantially the same results, <!-- Page 30
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>[30]</span>which, being
  published in 1846, led to the actual discovery of the planet Neptune by
  Galle of Berlin. In 1858 Adams was professor of mathematics at Aberdeen
  University, and in 1859 was appointed Lowndean professor of astronomy and
  geometry at Cambridge.</p>

  <p><b>Adams,</b> John Quincy, sixth president of the United States, son
  of John Adams, second president, was born 11th July, 1767. Accompanying
  his father to Europe he received part of his education there, but
  graduated at Harvard in 1788. Having adopted the legal profession, in
  1791 he was admitted to the bar. He now began to take an active interest
  in politics, and some letters that he wrote having attracted general
  attention, in 1794 Washington appointed him minister to the Hague. He
  afterwards was sent to Berlin, and also on a mission to Sweden. In 1798
  he received a commission to negotiate a treaty of commerce with Sweden.
  On the accession of Jefferson to the presidency in 1801 he was recalled.
  The Federalist party (that of his father), which was now declining, had
  sufficient influence in Massachusetts to elect him to the senate in 1803.
  On an important question of foreign policy, that of embargo, he abandoned
  his party, and having lost his re-election on this account, he retired to
  the professorship of rhetoric at Cambridge, which he held from 1806 to
  1809. In 1809 he went as ambassador to Russia. He assisted in negotiating
  the peace of 1814 with England, and was afterwards appointed resident
  minister at London. Under Monroe as president he was secretary of state,
  and at the expiration of Monroe's double term of office he succeeded him
  in the presidency (1825). He was not very successful as president, and at
  the end of his term (1829) he was not re-elected. In 1831 he was returned
  to Congress by Massachusetts, and continued to represent this State till
  his death, his efforts being now chiefly on behalf of the Abolitionist
  party. He died 21st Feb., 1848.</p>

  <p><b>Adams,</b> Samuel, an American statesman, second cousin of
  President John Adams, was born in Boston, 27th Sept., 1722, and was
  educated at Harvard College. He early devoted himself to politics, and in
  connection with the dispute between America and the mother country he
  showed himself one of the most unwearied, efficient, and disinterested
  assertors of American freedom and independence. He was one of the signers
  of the declaration of 1776, which he laboured most indefatigably to bring
  forward. He sat in congress eight years; from 1789-94 was
  lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts; from 1794-7 governor, when he
  retired from public life. He died 2nd Oct., 1803.</p>

  <p><b>Adam's Apple,</b> the popular name of the prominence seen in the
  front of the throat in man, and which is formed by the portion of the
  larynx known as the <i>thyroid cartilage</i>. It is much smaller and less
  visible in females than in males, and is so named from the supposition
  that it was caused by a piece of the forbidden fruit having stuck in
  Adam's throat. In botany it is the name given to the plantain tree and
  the <i>Citrus pomum</i>. It is the Heb. <i>Ethrog</i>, which, according
  to Hebrew legend, was the fruit Adam and Eve ate in the garden of
  Eden.</p>

  <p><b>Adam's Bridge,</b> a chain of reefs, sandbanks, and islands
  stretching between India and Ceylon; so called because the Mohammedans
  believe that when Adam was driven from paradise he had to pass by this
  way to Ceylon (where is also Adam's Peak). The Brahmans call it the
  bridge of Rama, the hero of the Indian Epic, the <i>Ramayana</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Adam's Needle,</b> a popular name of the Yucca plant.</p>

  <p><b>Adam's Peak,</b> one of the highest mountains in Ceylon, 45 miles
  east-south-east of Colombo, conical, isolated, and 7420 feet high. On the
  top, a rocky area of 64 feet by 45, is a hollow in the rock 5 feet long
  bearing a rude resemblance to a human foot, which the Brahmans believe to
  be the footprint of Siva; the Buddhists, who call it Sri-pada (sacred
  footmark), that of Buddha; the Mahommedans that of Adam. The last-named
  believe that Adam stood here on one foot for a thousand years, lamenting
  his exclusion from Eden. Devotees of all creeds meet here and present
  their offerings (chiefly rhododendron flowers) to the sacred footprint.
  The ascent is very steep, and towards the summit is assisted by steps cut
  and iron chains riveted in the rock.</p>

  <p><b>Adamson,</b> Patrick, a Scottish divine and Latin poet, born 15th

  <p><b>Adaptation</b> (from the Lat. <i>ad</i>, to, and
  <i>apt&#x101;re</i>, to fit), the process of modification or alteration
  <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>[31]</span>of
  a thing so as to change its original purpose and adapt it to other uses.
  Adaptation in biology is the power and process by which an organism or
  species of animals or plants changes and becomes modified, so as to suit
  the conditions of its life. In other words it is the adjustment, or
  favourable reaction, of the living world to its environment, the
  advantageous variation of animals and plants under changed conditions.
  The term now includes both that which is hereditary and that which is
  acquired. The powers of lower forms of life to adapt themselves to
  changes of environment are limited, and frequently, when the conditions
  vary suddenly, they are either arrested in their development or die
  altogether.&mdash;In literature it is the process by which an author
  modifies the work of another not in its essence but in its form and
  details, either in the original or in a foreign language.</p>

  <p><b>Adda,</b> a species of lizard, more commonly called Skink.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;dax,</b> a species of antelope (<i>Hippotr&#x103;gus

  make. The horns of the male are about 4 feet long, beautifully twisted
  into a wide-sweeping spiral of two turns and a half, with the points
  directed outwards. It has tufts of hair on the forehead and throat, and
  large broad hoofs. It inhabits the sandy regions of Nubia and Kordofan,
  and is also found in Caffraria.</p>

  form an administration, chiefly signalized by the conclusion of the Peace
  of Amiens. Quarrelled with Pitt, whom he bitterly attacked. Was home
  secretary from 1812 till 1822, his repressive policy making him

  educated at Trinity College, Harrogate, and St. Bartholomew's Hospital,
  London, where he was a lecturer for a time. He was elected Member of
  Parliament for the Hoxton Division, Shoreditch, in 1910, and was
  parliamentary secretary to the Board of Education from 1914 to 1915. From
  1916 to 1917 he was Minister of Munitions; he was President of the Local
  Government Board from January to June, 1919, when he became Minister of
  Health. He has written and edited several works on medical subjects.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;dison,</b> Joseph, an eminent English essayist, son of the
  Rev. Lancelot Addison, afterwards Dean of Lichfield, born at Milston,
  Wiltshire, 1st May, 1672, died 17th June, 1719. He was educated at the
  Charterhouse, where he became acquainted with Steele, and afterwards at
  Oxford. He held a fellowship from 1697 till 1711, and gained much praise
  for his Latin verse. He secured as his earliest patron the poet Dryden,
  who inserted some of his verses in his <i>Miscellanies</i> in 1693. A
  translation of the fourth <i>Georgic</i>, with the exception of the story
  of <i>Aristæus</i>, by Addison, appeared in the same collection in 1694,
  and he subsequently translated for it two and <!-- Page 32 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>[32]</span>a half books of Ovid.
  Dryden also prefixed his prose essay on Virgil's <i>Georgics</i> to his
  own translation of that poem, which appeared in 1697. An early patron of
  his was Charles Montague, afterwards Earl of Halifax; another was Lord
  Somers, who procured him a pension of £300 a year to enable him to
  qualify for diplomatic employments by foreign travels. He spent from the
  autumn of 1699 to that of 1703 on the Continent, where he became
  acquainted with Malebranche, Boileau, &amp;c. During his residence abroad
  his tragedy of <i>Cato</i> is supposed to have been written. During his
  journey across Mont Cenis he wrote his <i>Letter from Italy</i>, esteemed
  the best of his poems, and in Germany his <i>Dialogues on Medals</i>,
  which was not published till after his death. His <i>Remarks on Several
  Parts of Italy in the Years 1701-3</i> was published in 1705. His
  political friends lost power on the death of William III, but <i>The
  Campaign</i>, a poem on the battle of Blenheim, procured him an
  appointment as a commissioner of appeal on excise. In 1706 he received an
  under-secretaryship, in 1707 accompanied Halifax on a mission to Hanover,
  in 1709 became secretary to the Viceroy of Ireland, and keeper of the
  records. In 1708 he was elected Member of Parliament for Lostwithiel, a
  seat he exchanged in 1710 for Malmesbury, which place he continued to
  represent till his death. From Oct., 1709, to Jan., 1711, he contributed
  75 papers to the <i>Tatler</i>, either wholly by himself or in
  conjunction with Steele, thus founding the new literary school of the
  Essayists. For the <i>Spectator</i> (2nd Jan., 1711, to 6th Dec., 1712)
  he wrote 274 papers, all signed by one of the four letters C., L., I., O.
  His tragedy of <i>Cato</i>, produced April, 1713, ran for twenty nights,
  and was translated into French, Italian, German, and Latin. His other
  contributions to periodicals included 51 papers to the <i>Guardian</i>
  (May to Sept., 1713), 24 papers to a revived <i>Spectator</i> conducted
  by Budgell, and 2 papers to Steele's <i>Lover</i>. On the death of Queen
  Anne he successively became secretary to the lords justices, secretary to
  the Irish viceroy, and one of the lords commissioners of trade. He
  published the <i>Freeholder</i> (23rd Dec., 1715, to 9th June, 1716), a
  political <i>Spectator</i>. In August, 1716, he married the Countess of
  Warwick, a marriage which did not increase his happiness. He retired from
  public life, March, 1718, with a pension of £1500 a year. He formed a
  close friendship with Swift, and was chief of a distinguished literary
  circle. He had literary quarrels with Pope and Gay, the former of whom in
  revenge wrote the satire contained in his lines on Atticus in the
  <i>Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot</i>. He also had a paltry quarrel over
  politics with his old friend Steele. His death took place at Holland
  House, its cause being dropsy and asthma. He was buried in Westminster
  Abbey. Of his style as a writer so much has been said that nothing
  remains to say but to quote the dictum of Johnson: "Whoever wishes to
  attain an English style, familiar but not coarse, and elegant but not
  ostentatious, must give his days and nights to the volumes of Addison".
  He had great conversational powers, and his intimates speak in the
  strongest terms of the enjoyment derived from his society, but he was
  extremely reserved before strangers. His <i>Dialogues on Medals</i> and
  <i>Evidences of the Christian Religion</i> were published posthumously in
  Tickell's collected edition of his works.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Adelaide</b> (ad'e-l&#x101;d), the capital of South Australia, 6
  miles east from Port Adelaide (on St. Vincent Gulf), its port, with which
  it is united by railway, founded in 1837, and named after the queen of
  William IV. Situated on a large plain, it is built nearly in the form of
  a square, with the streets at right angles, and is divided into North and
  South Adelaide, separated by the river Torrens, which is crossed by
  several bridges, and by means of a dam is converted into a fine sheet of
  water. The public buildings comprise the Government House, the town hall,
  the post and telegraph offices, the Government offices, court-houses, the
  houses of legislature, the University, South Australian Institute,
  &amp;c. There is a good service of tramway cars. Adelaide is connected by
  railway with Melbourne, and is the terminus of the overland telegraph to
  Port Darwin. It has a large trade. Pop. (including suburbs), (1919),

  died in infancy. She became queen-consort on William attaining the throne
  in 1830, and was for a time unpopular from being supposed to be averse to
  reform. On the death of William she passed into private life, with an
  allowance of £100,000 a year.</p>

  <p><b>Adelard of Bath,</b> an English philosophical writer of the twelfth

  <p><b>Adelsberg</b> (ä'd&#x117;lz-ber<i>h</i>), a small town of North
  Italy, in Carniola, midway between Trieste and Laibach, remarkable for
  the wonderful stalactite cave in its vicinity. The most extended of the
  ramifications which compose it reaches to over 2 miles from the entrance,
  at which the River Poik disappears, and is heard rushing below. The
  stalactites and stalagmites are of the most varied and often beautiful
  forms, and have received fanciful appellations, as they resemble columns,

  <p><b>Adelung,</b> Johann Christoph, a German philologist, born 1732,
  died 1806. In 1759 he was appointed professor in the Protestant academy
  at Erfurt, and two years after removed to Leipzig, where he applied
  himself to the works by which he made so great a name, particularly his
  German dictionary, <i>Grammatisch-kritisches Wörterbuch der hochdeutschen
  Mundart</i> (Leipzig, 1774-86), and his <i>Mithridates</i>, a work on
  general philology. In 1787 he was appointed librarian of the public

  <p><b>A&prime;den,</b> a seaport town and territory belonging to Britain,
  on the south-west coast of Arabia, in <!-- Page 34 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page34"></a>[34]</span>a dry and barren
  district, the town being almost entirely closed in by an amphitheatre of
  rocks, and possessing an admirable harbour. Occupying an important
  military position, Aden is strongly fortified and permanently garrisoned.
  It is of importance also as a coaling station for steamers, and carries
  on a great amount of commerce, forming an entrepôt and place of
  transhipment for goods valued at £6,000,000 a year. Its greatest drawback
  is the scarcity of fresh water, which is obtained partly from wells,
  partly from rock-cisterns that receive the rain, and partly by
  condensation from salt water&mdash;the only unfailing means of supply.
  The peninsula on which it stands somewhat resembles the rock of
  Gibraltar, and could be rendered as formidable. Aden was a Roman colony,
  and in the Middle Ages it was a great entrepôt of the Eastern trade. It
  was acquired by Britain in 1839, after which it was attacked repeatedly
  by the Arabs. With the additional territory latterly acquired, the total
  British area is 75 sq. miles (or with the island of Perim, 80); while a
  large tract is under British influence. Aden is attached to the Bombay
  Presidency. Pop. 46,165.</p>

  <p><b>Adenanthe&prime;ra,</b> a genus of trees and shrubs, natives of the
  East Indies, nat. ord. Leguminosæ. <i>A. pavon&#x12B;na</i> is one of the
  largest and handsomest trees of India, and yields hard solid timber
  called red sandal-wood. The bright scarlet seeds, from their equality in
  weight (each=4 grains), are used by goldsmiths in the East as
  weights.</p>

  <p><b>Adeni&prime;tis</b> (Gr. <i>ad&#x113;n</i>, a gland), in medicine,

  <p><b>Adessena&prime;rian,</b> one of a sect of Christians which holds
  that there is a real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but denying
  that it is effected by transubstantiation.</p>

  <p><b>Adhesion,</b> the tendency of two bodies to stick together when put
  in close contact, or the mutual attraction of their surfaces;
  distinguished from <i>cohesion</i>, which denotes the mutual attraction
  between the particles of a homogeneous body. Adhesion may exist between
  two solids, between a solid and a fluid, or between two fluids. A plate
  of glass or of polished metal laid on the surface of water and attached
  to one arm of a balance will support much more than its own weight in the
  opposite scale from the force of adhesion between the water and the
  plate. From the same force arises the tendency of most liquids, when
  gently poured from a jar, to run down the exterior of a vessel or along
  any other surface they meet.</p>

  <p><b>Adian&prime;tum,</b> a genus of ferns; the maiden-hair fern.</p>

  <p><b>Adiaph&prime;orist</b> (Gr. <i>adiaphoros</i>, indifferent), a name

  <p><b>Adige</b> (ä&prime;d&#x113;-j&#x101;), Ger. <i>Etsch</i> (ancient
  <b>Ath&#x115;sis</b>), a river of Northern Italy, which rises in the
  Rhætian Alps, and after a south and east course of about 180 miles,
  during which it passes Verona and Legnago, falls into the Adriatic,
  forming a delta connected with that of the Po.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;ipocere</b> (-s&#x113;r) (Lat. <i>adeps</i>, fat, and
  <i>cera</i>, wax), a substance of a light-brown colour formed by animal
  matter when protected from atmospheric air, and under certain
  circumstances of temperature and humidity. It was first observed by
  Fourcroy, and a quantity discovered at the Cimetière des Innocents,
  Paris. A similar substance is found in peat-bogs in Wales and
  Ireland.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;ipose tissue,</b> the cellular tissue containing the oily

  <p><b>Ad&prime;it,</b> a more or less horizontal opening, giving access
  to the shaft of a mine. It is made to slope gradually from the farthest
  point in the interior to the mouth, and by means of it the principal
  drainage is usually carried on. See <i>Mine</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;jective,</b> in grammar, a word used to denote some
  quality in the noun or substantive to which it is accessory. The
  adjective is indeclinable in English (but has <i>degrees</i> of
  comparison), and generally precedes the noun, while in most other
  European languages it follows the inflections of the substantive, and is
  more commonly placed after it, though in German it precedes it, as in
  English.</p>

  <p><b>Adjudica&prime;tion,</b> in English law, is the decree of the court
  in bankruptcy declaring a person bankrupt.</p>

  <p><b>Adjust&prime;ment,</b> in marine insurance, is the settling of the

  </div>

  <p><b>Adjutant-bird</b> (<i>Leptopt&#x12D;lus arg&#x103;la</i>), a large
  grallatorial or wading bird of the stork family, native of the warmer
  parts of India, where it is known as Hurg&#x12D;la or Arg&#x103;la. It
  stands about five feet high, has an enormous bill, nearly bare head and
  neck, and a pouch hanging from the under part of the neck. It is one of
  the most voracious carnivorous birds known, and in India, from its
  devouring all sorts of carrion and noxious animals, is protected by law.
  From underneath the wings are obtained those light downy feathers known
  as <i>marabou</i> feathers, from the name of an allied species of bird
  (<i>L. marabou</i>) inhabiting Western Africa, and also producing
  them.</p>

  <p><b>Adjutant-general,</b> in Great Britain the second military member
  of the Army Council, and styled Adjutant-general to the Forces. He is a
  general officer, and at the head of his department at the War Office,
  which is charged with all duties relative to personnel.&mdash;Among the
  Jesuits this name was given to a select number of fathers, who resided
  with the general of the order, and had each a province or country
  assigned to him.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;jutators,</b> in English history, representatives elected
  by the parliamentary forces in 1647 to act with the officers in
  compelling Parliament to satisfy the demands of the army.</p>

  <p><b>Adler,</b> Victor, Austrian socialist leader, born in 1852.
  Educated as a physician, he gave up his profession for socialist

  this country. He was the founder and editor of the
  <i>Arbeiter-Zeitung</i>; was a member of the Lower Austrian Diet and of
  the Imperial Council in 1907. His son, Dr. Friedrich Adler, assassinated
  Count Stuergkh, the Austrian premier, on 20th Oct., 1916. He died in
  1918.</p>

  bound to account for them when required.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;miral,</b> the commander-in-chief of a squadron or fleet
  of ships of war, or of the entire naval force of a country, or simply a
  naval officer of the highest rank. In the British navy admirals are of
  four ranks&mdash;admiral of the fleet, admiral, vice-admiral, and
  rear-admiral. They were also divided formerly into three classes, named
  after the colours of their respective flags, admirals of the <i>red</i>,
  of the <i>white</i>, and of the <i>blue</i>. In 1864, however, this
  distinction was given up, and now there is one flag common to all ships
  of war, namely, the white ensign divided into four quarters by the cross
  of St. George, and having the union in the upper corner next the
  staff.&mdash;The title <i>admiral of the fleet</i> is conferred on a few
  admirals, and carries an increase of pay along with it.&mdash;A
  <i>vice-admiral</i> is next in rank and command to the admiral: he
  carries his flag at the foretop-gallant-mast head, while an admiral
  carries his at the main. A <i>rear-admiral</i>, next in rank to the
  vice-admiral, carries his flag at the mizzentop-gallant-mast
  head.&mdash;<i>Lord high admiral</i>, in Great Britain, an officer who
  (when this rare dignity is conferred) is at the head of the naval
  administration of Great Britain. There have been few high admirals since
  1632, when the office was first put in commission. James Duke of York
  (afterwards James II) held it for several years during Charles II's
  reign. In the reign of William and Mary it was vested in lords
  commissioners of the admiralty, and since that time it has been held for
  short periods only by Prince George of Denmark (1702-8) in the time of
  Queen Anne, and by William IV, then Duke of Clarence, in 1827-8.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;miralty,</b> that department of the Government of a
  country that is at the head of its naval service. In Britain the board of
  Admiralty now consists of the First Lord of the Admiralty and <!-- Page
  36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>[36]</span>seven other
  commissioners, four of them being Sea Lords, and one a Civil Lord. The
  First Lord is always a member of the cabinet, and it is he who
  principally exercises the powers of the department. Under the 1912
  Admiralty Organization Scheme, the various members of the board are
  responsible for special business. Several changes in Admiralty
  organization were made during the European War, but after the cessation
  of hostilities the system reverted to that of peace time.</p>

  <p><b>Admiralty Charts</b> are charts issued by the hydrographic
  department of the Admiralty of Britain; they are prepared by specially
  appointed surveyors and draughtsmen, and besides being supplied to every
  ship in the fleet, are sold to the general public at prices much less
  than their cost. In connection with these charts there are published
  books of sailing directions, lists of lights, &amp;c. The navigating
  charts are generally on the scale of half an inch to a mile, and show all
  the dangers of the coasts with sufficient distinctness to enable the
  seamen to avoid them; the charts of larger size exhibit all the
  intricacies of the coast.</p>

  <p><b>Admiralty Court,</b> a court which takes cognizance of civil and
  criminal causes of a maritime nature, including captures made in war, and
  offences committed on the high seas, and has to do with many matters
  connected with maritime affairs. In England the Admiralty Court was once
  held before the Lord High Admiral, and at a later period was presided
  over by his deputy or the deputy of the Lords Commissioners. It now forms
  a branch of the Probate, Divorce, and Admiralty division of the High
  Court of Justice. There is a separate Irish Admiralty Court. In Scotland
  Admiralty cases are now prosecuted in the Court of Session, or in the
  Sheriff Court. In the United States, Admiralty cases are taken up in the
  first instance by the district courts.</p>

  <p><b>Admiralty Island,</b> an island belonging to the United States off
  the north-west coast of North America, 80 or 90 miles long and about 20
  broad, covered with fine timber and inhabited by Sitka Indians.</p>

  <p><b>Admiralty Islands,</b> a cluster of 40 islands, north of New
  Guinea, in what was once called the Bismarck Archipelago. Discovered by
  the Dutch explorer Shouten in 1616, they were in German possession from
  1884 to 12th Sept., 1914, when they were occupied by an Australian force.
  They have since been in British occupation. The largest is about 60 miles
  in length; the rest are much smaller. They are covered with a luxuriant
  vegetation, and possess dense groves of coco-nut trees. There are
  valuable pearl and other shell fisheries. Capital, Lorengau. Pop.
  (native), 4000; (European), 50.</p>

  <p><b>Adonai</b> (ad&prime;o-n&#x12B;), a name bestowed upon God in the
  Old Testament. See <i>Jehovah</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ado&prime;ni,</b> a town and district in Madras; pop. of former
  30,416, of latter 179,418. It is well known for excellent silk and cotton
  fabrics.</p>

  <p><b>Ado&prime;nis,</b> son of Myrrha, a mythological personage,
  originally a deity of the Ph&oelig;nicians, but borrowed into Greek
  mythology. He was represented as being a great favourite of
  Aphrodit&#x113; (Venus), who accompanied him when engaged in hunting, of
  which he was very fond. He received a mortal wound from the tusk of a
  wild boar, and when the goddess hurried to his assistance she found him
  lifeless, whereupon she caused his blood to give rise to the anemone. The
  worship of Adonis, which arose in Ph&oelig;nicia, was afterwards widely
  spread round the Mediterranean. He is the reproductive principle,
  nature's decay in winter and its revival in spring. The name Adonis is
  akin to the Heb. <i>Adonai</i>, Lord. See <i>Tammuz</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ado&prime;nis,</b> a small river rising in Lebanon and flowing to
  the Mediterranean. When in flood it is tinged with a red colour, and so
  is connected with the legend of Adonis.</p>

  <p><b>Ado&prime;nis,</b> a genus of ranunculaceous plants. In the
  corn-adonis or pheasant's eye (<i>A. autumn&#x101;lis</i>) the petals are
  bright scarlet like the blood of Adonis, from which the plant is fabled
  to have sprung.</p>

  <p><b>Adoptianism,</b> the theory according to which <!-- Page 37
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>[37]</span>Christ as a man
  is the adopted Son of God. Elipandus, Archbishop of Toledo, and Felix,
  Bishop of Urgella, asserted this double sonship in Christ, maintaining
  that He was indeed the Son of God in His divine nature, but as man He was
  the Son of God only by grace and adoption. 'The Man Christ' is therefore
  only the adopted and not the natural Son of God. The doctrine was
  vigorously opposed by Alcuin, and condemned by the councils of Ratisbon
  (792) and Frankfort (794). The theory, however, found advocates during
  the Middle Ages, and has given rise to theological disputes in modern
  times. Adoptianism was attributed both to Abelard and Duns Scotus.</p>

  <p><b>Adop&prime;tion,</b> the admission of a stranger by birth to the
  privileges of a child. Among the ancient Greeks and Romans, and also some
  modern nations, adoption is placed under legal regulation. In Rome the
  effect of adoption was to create the legal relation of father and son,
  just as if the person adopted was born of the blood of the adopter in
  lawful marriage. The adopted son took the name of his adopter, and was
  bound to perform his new father's religious duties. Adoption is not
  recognized by the law of England and Scotland; there are legal means to
  enable a person to assume the name and arms, and to inherit the property
  of another. In some of the United States adoption is regulated by laws
  not very dissimilar to those which prevailed among the Romans.</p>

  Pope in 1154, his reign is chiefly remarkable for his almost constant
  struggle for supremacy with Frederick Barbarossa, who on one occasion had
  been forced to hold his stirrup, and had been crowned by him at Rome
  (1155). He issued the famous bull (1158) granting the sovereignty of
  Ireland, on condition of the payment of Peter's pence, to Henry
  II.&mdash;<b>Adrian V,</b> previously called <b>Ottobuono Fieschi,</b> of
  Genoa, settled, as legate of the Pope, the dispute between King Henry III
  of England and his nobles, in favour of the former; but died a month
  after his election to the papal chair (1276).&mdash;<b>Adrian VI</b> (the
  last pontifice barbaro), born at Utrecht in 1459, was elected to the
  papal chair, 9th Jan., 1522. He tried to reform abuses in the Church, but
  opposed the zeal of Luther with reproaches and threats, and even
  attempted to excite Erasmus and Zuinglius against him. Died 1523, after a
  reign of one year and a half.</p>

  the Balkans, about 135 miles <span class="scac">W.N.W.</span> from
  Constantinople, on the Maritza (ancient <i>Hebrus</i>), at its junction
  with the Tundja and the Arda. It has a great mosque, among the most

  Adrianople received its present name from the Roman emperor Adrian
  (Hadrian). In 1361 it was taken by Amurath I, and was the residence of
  the Turkish sovereigns till the conquest of Constantinople in 1453. In
  1829 it was taken by the Russians, and here was then concluded the peace
  of Adrianople, by which Russia received important accessions of territory
  in the Caucasus and on the coast of the Black Sea. The Russians occupied
  it also in 1878. Adrianople was bombarded by the Balkan allied forces in
  Feb., 1913, and fell 28th March; it was recaptured by the Turks, under
  Enver Bey, 20th July. Pop. 83,000.</p>

  <p><b>Adrian's</b> (or <b>Hadrian's</b>) <b>Wall</b>. See <i>Roman

  <p><b>Adriat&prime;ic Sea,</b> or <b>Gulf of Venice,</b> an arm of the
  Mediterranean, stretching in a north-westerly direction from the Straits
  of Otranto, between Italy and the Balkan Peninsula (Yugo-Slavia). Length,
  about 480 miles; average breadth, about 100; area, about 60,000 sq.
  miles. The rivers which it receives, particularly the Po, its principal
  feeder, have produced, and are still producing, great geological changes
  in its basin by their alluvial deposits. Hence Adria, between the Po and
  the Adige, which gives the sea its name, though once a flourishing
  seaport, is now 17 miles inland. An oceanographic investigation of the
  Adriatic Sea took place in Feb. and March, 1911. The principal trading
  ports on the Italian side are Brindisi, Bari, Ancona, Sinigaglia, and
  Venice; on the east side Ragusa, Fiume, Pirano, Pola, and Trieste
  (Italian).</p>

  <p><b>Adscripti Glebæ</b> (Lat., persons attached to the soil), a term
  applied to a class of Roman slaves attached in perpetuity to and
  transferred with the land they cultivated. Colliers and salt workers in
  Scotland were in a similar position till 1775.</p>

  <p><b>Adula&prime;ria,</b> a very pure, limpid, translucent variety of
  the common felspar, called by lapidaries <i>moonstone</i>, on account of
  the play of light exhibited by the arrangement of its crystalline
  structure. It is found on the Alps, but the best specimens are brought
  from Ceylon. It is so called from <i>Adula</i>, one of the peaks of St.
  Gothard, where fine specimens are got.</p>

  <p><b>Adul&prime;lam, Cave of,</b> a cave to which David fled when
  persecuted by Saul, and whither he was followed by "every one who was in
  distress, in debt, or discontented" (1 <i>Sam.</i> xxii, 1, 2).&mdash;The
  name <i>Adullamites</i> was given to an English political party,
  consisting of R. Lowe, Lord Elcho, and other Liberals, who opposed the
  majority of their party on the Franchise Bill of 1866. The term
  originated from a speech of John Bright on 13th March, 1866.</p>

  <p><b>Adultera&prime;tion,</b> a term applied to the fraudulent mixture
  of articles of commerce, foods, drugs, beverages, seeds, &amp;c., with
  inferior ingredients, and also to any accidental impurity found in a
  substance. The chief objects of adulteration are to render a substance
  more pleasing in appearance, to increase the weight, to make an inferior
  article appear as good as the article of superior quality. Any substance
  added to an article to increase its bulk, weight, colour, &amp;c., is
  spoken of as an adulterant. Milk is often adulterated with water and with
  colouring-matter. Butter may be adulterated by mixing with it other fats
  or by the addition of colouring-matter. Nearly every article of food can
  be adulterated in some way to make it appear of finer quality.
  <i>Preservatives</i> added to foods and drugs generally may be classed as
  adulterants. Thus cream is preserved by adding small quantities of boric
  acid. Beer sometimes contains salicylic acid added as a preservative.
  Chloroform contains a small quantity of alcohol to prevent decomposition.
  Methylated spirits is alcohol adulterated in several ways to render it
  unfit for human consumption. Tobacco contains benzoic acid as
  preservative, and sometimes saltpetre to aid burning. Many of these
  adulterants are harmful, so that such added to foods and beverages must
  be present only in very small quantities. Food and Drug Acts lay down the
  limits of the quantities of foreign matter permitted either as
  preservative or impurity. Practically every article of commerce is
  adulterated in some way, and pure substances are seldom used. Cf. Walker,
  <i>The Food Inspector's Encyclopædia</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Adul&prime;tery,</b> the voluntary sexual intercourse of a married
  person with any other than the offender's husband or wife; when committed
  between two married persons, the offence is called double, and when
  between a married and single person, single adultery. The Mosaic, Greek,
  and early Roman law only recognized the offence when a married woman was
  the offender. By the Jewish law it was punished with death. In Greece the
  laws against it were severe. By the laws of Draco and Solon adulterers,
  when caught in the act, were at the mercy of the injured party. In early
  Rome the punishment was left to the discretion of the husband and parents
  of the adulteress. The punishment assigned by the Lex Julia, under
  Augustus, was banishment or a heavy fine. Under Constantius and Constans,
  adulterers were burned or sewed in sacks and thrown into the sea; under
  Justinian the wife was to be scourged, lose her dower, and be shut up in
  a monastery; at the expiration of two years the husband might take her
  again; if he refused she was shaven and made a nun for life. By the
  ancient laws of France this crime was punishable with death. In Spain
  personal mutilation was frequently the punishment adopted. In several
  European countries adultery is regarded as a <!-- Page 39 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>[39]</span>criminal offence, but in
  none does the punishment exceed imprisonment for a short period,
  accompanied by a fine. In England formerly it was punishable with fine
  and imprisonment, and in Scotland it was frequently made a capital
  offence. In Great Britain at the present day, however, it is punishable
  only by ecclesiastical censure. The aggrieved husband, however, can
  obtain damages against his wife's seducer. In England a man can obtain a
  dissolution of his marriage on the ground of his wife's adultery, and a
  wife can obtain a judicial separation on the ground of her husband's
  adultery, or a dissolution of the marriage if the offence is coupled with
  cruelty, desertion, or bigamy. In Scotland it is not necessary to prove
  cruelty. In the United States the punishment of adultery has varied
  materially at different times. It is, however, very seldom punished
  criminally in the States. A person divorced for adultery is by the laws
  of France and Scotland prohibited from intermarrying with the
  co-respondent.</p>

  <p><b>Ad valo&prime;rem</b> (Lat., according to the value), a term
  applied to customs or duties levied according to the worth of the goods,
  as sworn to by the owner, and not according to number, weight, measure,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Advance-note,</b> a draft on the owner of a vessel, generally for
  one month's wages, given by the master to the sailors on their signing
  the articles of agreement. The granting of such notes to British sailors
  was made illegal by an Act passed in 1880.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;vent</b> (Lat. <i>adventus</i>, an arrival, 'the coming of
  our Saviour'), the name applied to the holy season which occupies the
  four or, according to the Greek Church, six weeks preceding Christmas,
  and which forms the first portion of the ecclesiastical year, as observed
  by the Anglican, the Roman Catholic, and the Greek Church.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;ventists,</b> a group of six American religious sects who
  believe in the speedy coming of Christ, and generally practise adult
  immersion. The first sect of Adventists was founded by William Miller in
  1831.&mdash;There is also a sect called <i>Seventh-day Adventists</i>,
  who hold that the coming of Christ is at hand, and maintain that the
  Sabbath is still the seventh day of the week.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;verb,</b> one of the parts of speech used to limit or
  qualify the signification of an adjective, verb, or other adverb; as,
  <i>very cold</i>, <i>naturally brave</i>, <i>much more clearly</i>,
  <i>readily agreed</i>. Adverbs may be classified as follows: (1) Adverbs
  of time, as, <i>now</i>, <i>then</i>, <i>never</i>, &amp;c.; (2) of
  place, as, <i>here</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>where</i>, &amp;c.; (3) of
  degree, as, <i>very</i>, <i>much</i>, <i>nearly</i>, <i>almost</i>,
  &amp;c.; (4) of affirmation, negation, or doubt, as, <i>yes</i>,
  <i>no</i>, <i>certainly</i>, <i>perhaps</i>, &amp;c.; (5) of manner, as,
  <i>well</i>, <i>badly</i>, <i>clearly</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Advertis&prime;ing.</b> Advertising on a small scale is a practice
  as old as commerce; but modern advertising on a large scale cannot be
  dated further back than 1785, when the <i>Times</i> was founded. The last
  thirty years have witnessed a great increase in the importance of
  advertisements as part of the policy of a progressive business. Much more
  intelligence and vastly more money is now spent on advertising than ever
  was before. America led the way, but the British are not now far behind
  in the number and ingenuity of their advertisements.</p>

  <p>There are roughly speaking five distinct types of
  advertisement:&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1) Press advertising, under which heading is included daily and
  weekly newspapers, monthly magazines and year books, directories,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p>(2) Mail-order advertising, which comprises form-letters,
  catalogues.</p>

  <p>(3) Poster and showcard advertising. This includes large and small
  posters, on hoardings, in railway stations or tubes, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>(4) Illuminated signs either outside buildings on a large scale or in
  frames of various sizes inside business premises, theatres, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>(5) Cinema advertising&mdash;a recent development which has proved
  extremely effective.</p>

  <p>Advertising to be successful must be carefully organized. A firm
  wishing to advertise must first of all settle how much money it is
  willing to spend on this object. A common practice is to devote a fixed
  proportion of the profits&mdash;at least five per cent&mdash;to
  advertising. The firm must then carefully consider the period of time
  over which the expenditure agreed upon is to be spread. Occasional or
  spasmodic advertising does not produce satisfactory results; advertising
  must be constant and must move with the times in order to be effective. A
  firm not uncommonly reviews the results of its advertising every six
  months, when it also arranges its plans for future advertisements.
  Mistakes in policy can thus be corrected and successful schemes can be
  readopted or improved upon. Advertising on any large scale must be
  handled by experts. Many thousands of pounds are wasted yearly by firms
  which hand over this work to a director who has no knowledge of how to
  advertise. The proper way for a firm to act, if it wishes to enter upon a
  campaign of publicity, is to engage an efficient advertising staff or to
  employ a reliable advertising agent. These agents in many cases obtain
  their profits from the commission given to them by newspapers&mdash;this
  often being about ten per cent of the cost of the space booked. In return
  for this they give their advice and copy&mdash;everything, indeed, except
  blocks and sketches.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Henry
  Sampson, <i>A History of Advertising</i>; <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, Feb.,
  1843, <i>On the Advertising System</i>. A good account of the <!-- Page

  <p><b>Ad vitam aut culpam</b> (Lat., for life or till a fault), a formula
  often used in regard to appointments to posts or offices, intimating that
  they are held for life or till the person forfeits his position by some
  fault or misdeed.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;vocate</b> (Lat., <i>advocatus</i>&mdash;<i>ad</i>, to,
  <i>voco</i>, to call), a lawyer authorized to plead the cause of his
  clients before a court of law. It is only in Scotland that this word
  seems to denote a distinct class belonging to the legal profession, the
  advocates of Scotland being the pleaders before the supreme courts, and
  corresponding to the <i>barristers</i> of England and Ireland. These
  advocates all belong to the <i>Faculty of Advocates</i>, Edinburgh, to
  whom the oral pleadings in the Court of Session are for the most part
  limited, while they are also competent to plead in all the inferior
  Scottish courts and in the House of Lords in cases of appeal from the
  Court of Session. The supreme judges in Scotland, as well as the sheriffs
  of the various counties, are always selected from among them. Candidates
  for admission must undergo two separate examinations, one in general
  scholarship and the other in law.&mdash;The <i>Lord-Advocate</i>, called
  also the <i>King's</i> or <i>Queen's Advocate</i>, is the principal law
  officer of the crown in Scotland. He is the public prosecutor of crimes
  in the Supreme Court, and senior counsel for the crown in civil causes.
  Being appointed by the crown, he goes out of office with the
  administration to which he belongs. As public prosecutor he is assisted
  by the solicitor-general and by four junior counsel called
  advocates-depute. The lord-advocate and the solicitor-general, in
  addition to their official duties, accept of ordinary bar practice.</p>

  <p><b>Advocates' Library,</b> the chief library in Scotland, located in
  Edinburgh, and founded about 1682 by the Faculty of Advocates. It was
  increased by donations and by sums granted by the Faculty from time to
  time. As the donations were not confined to advocates the library was
  considered a kind of public library, and it has continued to retain this
  character. In 1709 it obtained, along with eight other libraries, the
  right to demand a copy of every new book published in Britain, which
  right it still possesses. The number of volumes is over 600,000 and MSS.
  over 3200.</p>

  <p><b>Advoca&prime;tus Diab&prime;oli</b> (Devil's advocate), in the
  Roman Catholic Church, a functionary who, when a deceased person is
  proposed for canonization, brings forward and insists upon all the weak
  points of the character and life of the deceased, endeavouring to show
  that he is not worthy of sainthood. The first formal mention of such an
  officer occurs under Pope Leo X (1513-21). The opposite side is taken by
  the <i>Advocatus Dei</i> (God's advocate).</p>

  <p><b>Advow&prime;son,</b> in English law, a right of presentation to a
  vacant benefice, or, in other words, a right of nominating a person to
  officiate in a vacant church. Those who have this right are styled
  <i>patrons</i>. Advowsons are of three kinds&mdash;<i>presentative</i>,
  <i>collative</i>, and <i>donative</i>: <i>presentative</i>, when the
  patron presents his clerk to the bishop of the diocese to be instituted;
  <i>collative</i>, when the bishop is the patron, and institutes or
  <i>collates</i> his clerk by a single act; <i>donative</i>, when a church
  is founded by the king, or any person licensed by him, without being
  subject to the ordinary, so that the patron confers the benefice on his
  clerk without presentation, institution, or induction. An advowson cannot
  be held by either a Roman Catholic or an alien.</p>

  <p><b>Ad&prime;ytum,</b> a secret place of retirement in the ancient
  temples, esteemed the most sacred spot; the innermost sanctuary or
  shrine. From this place the oracles were given, and none but the priests
  were permitted to enter it. The Holy of Holies or Sanctum Sanctorum of
  the Temple at Jerusalem was of a similar character.</p>

  <p><b>Adze,</b> a cutting instrument used for chipping the surface of
  timber, somewhat of a mattock shape, and having a blade of steel forming
  a portion of a cylindrical surface, with a cutting edge at right angles
  to the length of the handle.</p>

  <p><b>Ædiles</b> (&#x113;&prime;d&#x12B;lz), Roman magistrates who had
  the supervision of the national games and spectacles; of the public
  edifices, such as temples (the name comes from <i>ædes</i>, a temple); of
  private buildings, of the markets, cleansing and draining the city,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Æ&prime;dui,</b> one of the most powerful nations of Gaul, between
  the Liger (Loire) and the Arar (Saône). On the arrival of Julius Cæsar in
  Gaul (58 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) they were subject to Ariovistus,
  but their independence was restored by Cæsar. Their chief town was
  Bibracte (Mont Beuvray, near Autun).</p>

  <p><b>Ægade&prime;an Islands,</b> a group of small islands lying off the
  western extremity of Sicily, and consisting of Maritimo, Favignana,
  Levanso, and Le Formiche.</p>

  <p><b>Ægean Civilization,</b> a term applied to the pre-Hellenic
  civilization of south-eastern Europe, including Crete, Greece and the
  Cyclades, and the Danubian or Mid-European area. See <i>Crete</i> and
  <i>Danubian Civilization</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ægean Sea</b> (&#x113;-j&#x113;&prime;an), that part of the
  Mediterranean which washes the eastern shores of <!-- Page 41 --><span

  coast of Asia Minor. See <i>Archipelago</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Æ&prime;gilops,</b> a genus of grasses, very closely allied to
  wheat, and somewhat remarkable from the alleged fact that by cultivation
  one of the species becomes a kind of wheat.</p>

  <p><b>Ægina</b> (&#x113;-j&#x12B;&prime;na), a Greek island in the Gulf
  of Ægina, south of Athens, triangular in form; area about 32 sq. miles;
  pop. 8500. It forms part of the nomarchy of Attica and B&oelig;otia.
  Except in the west, where the surface is more level, the island is
  mountainous and unproductive. The inhabitants are chiefly engaged in
  trade, seafaring, and agriculture, the chief crops being almonds, olives,
  and grain. The greater number of them reside in the seaport town of
  Ægina. Ægina was anciently colonized by Dorians from the opposite coast
  of Peloponnesus. In the latter half of the sixth century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> it had a flourishing commerce, a large navy, and
  was the seat of a distinct school of art. At the battle of Salamis (480
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) the Æginetans behaved with great valour.
  In 456 the island fell under the power of the Athenians, and in 431 the
  Æginetans were expelled to make room for Athenian settlers, but were
  afterwards restored. On a hill are the remains of a splendid temple of
  Athena (Minerva), many of the columns of which are still standing. Here
  was found in 1811 a considerable amount of sculpture from the pediments
  (the <i>Æginetan marbles</i>), which is now at the Glyptothek at Munich,
  and is prized as throwing light on the early history of Greek art. Though
  in these figures there is a wonderfully exact imitation of nature, yet
  there is a certain stiffness about them and an unnatural sameness of
  expression in all. They should probably be assigned to the period 500-480
  <span class="scac">B.C.</span></p>

  <p><b>Ægis</b> (&#x113;&prime;jis), the shield of Zeus, according to
  Homer, but according to later writers and artists a metal cuirass or
  breastplate, in which was set the head of the Gorgon Medusa, and with
  which Athena (Minerva) is often represented as being protected. In a
  figurative sense the word is used to denote some shielding or protecting
  power.</p>

  <p><b>Ægle</b> (&#x113;&prime;gl&#x113;), a genus of plants. See
  <i>Bel.</i></p>

  <p><b>Ægospot&prime;ami</b> ('goat-rivers'), a place on the Hellespont,
  of some note in Greek history, the Athenian fleet being here completely
  defeated in 405 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> by the Spartan Lysander,
  thus ending the Peloponnesian war.</p>

  <p><b>Ælfric</b> (al&prime;frik), Abbot, called <i>Grammaticus</i> (the
  grammarian), was a celebrated English author of the eleventh century. He
  became a monk of Abingdon, was afterwards connected with Winchester, and
  died Abbot of Eynsham. His principal works are two books of homilies, a
  <i>Treatise on the Old and New Testaments</i>, a translation and
  abridgment of the first seven books of the Bible, a <i>Latin Grammar and
  Glossary</i>, &amp;c. He has been frequently confounded both with Ælfric,
  Archbishop of Canterbury, and Ælfric, Archbishop of York, surnamed Putta,
  who lived about the same time. There was also an Ælfric of
  Malmesbury.</p>

  <p><b>Ælia&prime;nus,</b> Claudius, often called simply <b>Ælian,</b> a
  Roman author who lived about <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 221, and
  wrote in Greek a collection of stories and anecdotes and a natural
  history of animals.</p>

  <p><b>Ælia&prime;nus Tacticus,</b> so called to distinguish him from
  Claudius Ælianus, lived at Rome, and wrote a work <i>On the Military
  Tactics of the Greeks</i>, which he dedicated to the Emperor Hadrian, who
  was emperor from <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 117 to 138. This book was
  closely studied by soldiers of the sixteenth and seventeenth
  centuries.</p>

  <p><b>Aelst</b> (älst), Belgian town, same as <b>Alost</b>.</p>

  <p><b>Æne&prime;as,</b> the hero of Virgil's <i>Æn&#x113;id</i>, a
  Trojan, who, according to Homer, was, next to Hector, the bravest of the
  warriors of Troy. When that town was taken and set on fire, Æneas,
  according to the narrative of Virgil, with his father, son, and wife
  Creusa, fled, but the latter was lost in the confusion of the flight.
  Having collected a fleet he sailed for Italy, but after numerous
  adventures he was driven by a tempest to the coast of Africa, where Queen
  Dido of Carthage received him kindly, and would have married him.
  Jupiter, however, sent Mercury to Æneas, and commanded him to sail to
  Italy. Whilst the deserted Dido ended her life on the funeral pile, Æneas
  set sail with his companions, and after further adventures by land and
  sea reached the <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page42"></a>[42]</span>country of King Latinus, in Italy. The
  king's daughter Lavinia was destined by an oracle to wed a stranger, this
  stranger being Æneas, but was promised by her mother to Turnus, King of
  the R&#x16D;t&#x16D;li. This occasioned a war, which was ended by Æneas
  slaying Turnus and marrying Lavinia. His son by Lavinia, Æneas Sylvius,
  was the ancestor of the kings of Alba Longa, and of Romulus and Remus,
  the founders of the city of Rome.</p>

  <p><b>Æolian Harp,</b> or <b>Æolus' Harp,</b> a musical instrument,
  generally consisting of a box of thin fibrous wood (often of deal), to
  which are attached from eight to fifteen fine catgut strings or wires,
  stretched on low bridges at either end, and tuned in unison. Its length
  is made to correspond with the size of the window or other aperture in
  which it is intended to be placed. When the wind blows athwart the
  strings it produces very beautiful sounds, sweetly mingling all the
  harmonic tones, and swelling or diminishing according to the strength or
  weakness of the blast.</p>

  <p><b>Æolians</b> (Gr. <i>Aioleis</i>), one of the four races into which
  the ancient Greeks were divided, originally inhabiting the district of
  Æ&#x14F;lis, in Thessaly, from which they spread over other parts of
  Greece. In early times they were the most numerous and powerful of the
  Hellenic races, chiefly inhabiting Northern Greece and the western side
  of Peloponnesus, though latterly a portion of them went to Lesbos and
  Tenedos and the north-west shores of Asia Minor, where they possessed a
  number of cities. Their language, the Æolian dialect, was one of the
  three principal dialects of the Greek. It was cultivated for literary
  purposes chiefly at Lesbos, and was the dialect in which Alcæus and
  Sappho wrote.</p>

  <p><b>Æol&prime;ipile</b> (Lat. <i>Æ&#x14F;li pila</i>, the ball of
  Æ&#x14F;lus), a spherical vessel of metal, with a pipe of small aperture,
  through which the vapour of heated water in the ball passes out with
  considerable noise; or having two nozzles so placed that the steam
  rushing out causes it to revolve on the principle of the Barker's mill.
  It was known to the ancient Greeks.</p>

  <p><b>Æ&prime;olus,</b> in Greek mythology, the god of the winds, which
  he kept confined in a cave in the Æolian Islands, releasing them when he
  wished or was commanded by the superior gods.</p>

  <p><b>Æ&prime;on,</b> a Greek word signifying life, an age, and sometimes
  eternity, but used by the Gnostics to express spirits or powers that had
  emanated from the Supreme Mind before the beginning of time. They held
  both Christ and the Holy Spirit to be æons; but as they denied the divine
  origin of the books of Moses, they said that the spirit which had
  inspired him and the prophets was not that exalted æon whom God sent
  forth after the ascension of Christ, but an æon very much inferior, and
  removed at a great distance from the Supreme Being.</p>

  <p><b>Æpyor&prime;nis,</b> a genus of gigantic birds whose remains have
  been found in Madagascar, where they are supposed to have lived perhaps
  not longer than 200 years ago. It had three toes, and is classed with the
  cursorial birds (ostrich, &amp;c.). Its eggs measured 14 inches in
  length, being about six times the bulk of those of the ostrich. The bird
  which laid them may well have been the roc of Eastern tradition.</p>

  <p><b>Æ&prime;qui,</b> an ancient people of Italy, conspicuous in the
  early wars of Rome, and inhabiting the mountain district between the
  upper valley of the Anio (Teverone) and Lake Fuc&#x12D;nus. They were
  probably akin to the Volscians, with whom they were in constant alliance.

  <p><b>A&prime;erated Bread,</b> bread which receives its sponginess or
  porosity from carbonic acid supplied artificially, and not produced by
  the fermentation caused by leaven or yeast.</p>

  <p><b>A&prime;erated Waters,</b> waters impregnated with carbonic acid
  gas, and forming effervescing beverages. Some mineral waters are
  naturally aerated, as Vichy, Apollinaris, Rosbach, &amp;c.; others,
  especially such as are used for medicinal purposes, are frequently
  aerated to render them more palatable and exhilarating. Water simply
  aerated, as soda-water, or aerated and flavoured with lemon or fruit
  syrups, is largely used, especially in summer, as a refreshing beverage.
  There are numerous varieties of apparatus for manufacturing aerated
  waters. The essential parts of an aerated-water machine are a generator
  in which the gas is produced, a vessel containing the water to be
  impregnated, and an apparatus for forcing the gas into the water. This
  last may be effected by force-pumps or by the high pressure of the
  impregnating gas itself. The quantity of gas with which the water is
  charged is usually equal to a pressure of 5 atmospheres. See also

  <p><b>Aerial Ropeways</b> or <b>Cableways,</b> a means of transport or
  carriage in which a great rope or cable, elevated above the ground on
  fixed supports, is made use of in conveying from place to place materials
  or articles of various kinds. Such a cable may be said to serve the
  purpose of a rail, from which are suspended the carriages, buckets, or
  carriers of whatever sort are employed to convey the materials dealt
  with, the cable being actuated by means of a steam-engine and
  winding-gear of suitable construction. Such cables are now much used in
  carrying materials <!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  quarries, excavations for canals, docks, &amp;c.; in the construction of
  bridges, in shipbuilding, &amp;c. Besides being employed in such
  works&mdash;not to mention the coaling of a battleship at sea from a coal
  transport standing by&mdash;elevated ropeways miles in length have also
  been constructed between places where no roads exist, or where road
  carriage is much more expensive. The greatest aerial line yet in
  existence is in the Argentine Republic, being built to connect a mining
  locality in the Andes, about 15,000 feet above sea-level, with a station
  on the Northern Railway 11,500 feet lower down and about 22 miles off,
  the line running across deep chasms and hollows, and being in places
  supported on iron towers 130 feet high. The wire rope is said to have a
  length of 87 miles.</p>

  <p><b>Aeronau&prime;tics,</b> the art or science of navigating the air,
  including Aviation (see <i>Aeroplane</i> and <i>Sea-planes</i>) and
  Aerostation (see <i>Balloons</i> and <i>Air-ships</i>). From the days of
  the mythical exploit of Dædalus and Icarus, students of 'experimental
  philosophy', or scientists, of all ages, turned their thoughts and
  inventive genius to the evolution of a machine by means of which man
  could fly. Most of the early schemes of which any details have survived
  were based upon the observation of birds and embodied the flapping of
  wings affixed to the arms or legs. Among the very early experimenters may
  be mentioned the monk Oliver of Malmesbury (<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 1050), de Pérouse (1420), who is said to have
  succeeded in flying over Lake Trasimene, and the great Leonardo da Vinci.
  All these produced designs for what are known as Ornithopters, or
  flapping-wing machines. There was, however, another school which believed
  in the future of machines which would be themselves lighter than air. The
  idea in the minds of the experimenters of this school was in the early
  days the replacing of the air in brass globes by a vacuum. If the brass
  were thin enough it was believed that the globe would then be
  sufficiently light to rise. It was, however, not realized that under such
  circumstances the globe would inevitably collapse under the pressure of
  the atmosphere with no corresponding internal pressure to withstand it.
  Among this 'lighter-than-air' school of experimenters were the famous
  Roger Bacon (twelfth century), Robert Hooke of the Royal Society (1644),
  and Francesco de Lana, a Jesuit priest (1660). It was this school which
  ultimately achieved success by providing the first machine of any sort to
  leave the ground and rise into the air. On 5th June, 1783, the first
  balloon ascended from the village of Annonay in France. It owed its
  inception to the genius of two brothers, paper-makers by trade, named
  Etienne and Joseph Montgolfier. Struck by the sight of smoke ascending
  from a chimney, after many failures with flapping-wing models, they
  conceived the idea of filling a receptacle with smoke and seeing if it
  would rise. They built a balloon or 'globe' of paper and canvas, and lit
  a fire of wood and straw below the aperture in it. The balloon gradually
  filled and rose into the air to a height reported to be 6000 feet, though
  this is probably an exaggeration. It remained in the air for ten minutes
  and landed 1½ miles away. This was the forerunner of the <!-- Page 44
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>[44]</span>'Montgolfières',
  or hot-air balloons, which are a feature of fêtes and Guy Fawkes' Day
  celebrations. It was followed by the sending up of a 'Montgolfière' from
  Versailles on 18th Sept. of the same year, carrying a basket containing a
  sheep, a cock, and a duck. The first human beings to make an ascent were
  Pilâtre de Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlande, who went away from Paris on
  21st Nov., 1783. They passed right over Paris, and were in the air for
  twenty-five minutes, during which time they replenished the fire
  suspended in a brazier below the neck of the balloon.</p>

  <p>The real genesis of the balloon, or air-ship as we know it to-day, was
  due to the discovery of hydrogen as the lightest gas, which discovery was
  made in 1766 by an English chemist, Henry Cavendish. Various people claim
  the credit of having been the first to call attention to the
  possibilities of this gas for aerial navigation. In 1781 Dr. Joseph Black
  of Edinburgh suggested to his pupils that a thin bladder filled with 'the
  inflammable gas' (hydrogen) would rise into the air, but it appears
  doubtful whether he ever actually made the experiment. Tiberius Cavallo
  the same year, before the Royal Society, demonstrated that soap-bubbles
  filled with hydrogen would rise and float in the air. The honour of
  building the first hydrogen balloon belongs, however, to three
  Frenchmen&mdash;the brothers Robert, and Charles, a physicist. They sent
  up a hydrogen-filled balloon of varnished silk from the Champ de Mars,
  Paris, on 7th Aug., 1783. One of the Roberts and Charles themselves made
  the second human ascent in their balloon&mdash;the first in a hydrogen
  balloon as opposed to a Montgolfière (as above)&mdash;on 1st Dec. the
  same year. In 1784 the same Frenchmen constructed the first 'air-ship' or
  navigable balloon to the order of the Duc de Chartres (Philippe Egalité).
  The gas container of this was elongated in form, and it could be
  propelled to some small extent by means of oars, and steered by a rudder.
  In the same year a French military officer, named Meusnier, produced a
  completely detailed design for an air-ship. This embodied the first
  suggestion of screw-propellers, to be worked by man-power, and also
  provided for a 'ballonet' into which air could be driven to replace
  hydrogen lost owing to expansion during the ascent. Meusnier's design was
  the genesis of the modern non-rigid air-ship, all the essential features
  remaining. This air-ship was, however, never built.</p>

    Giffard's Steam-driven Air-ship
  </div>

  <p>The first ascent in the British Isles was made in a Montgolfière by
  James Tytler at Edinburgh, on 27th Aug., 1784, though he travelled only a
  few hundred yards. He was followed by Vincent Lunardi, an Italian, who
  ascended from the artillery ground in London three weeks later (Sept.,
  1784), landing near Ware in Hertfordshire. The first Channel crossing by
  air was made in a hydrogen balloon from Dover to Calais on 7th Jan.,
  1785, by Blanchard and Dr. Jeffries.</p>

  <p>Subsequent developments in air-ships are due to the pioneer work of
  Giffard (1852) (the first steam-driven air-ship), Dupuy de Lôme (1872),
  the brothers Tissandier (electric propulsion) (1883), Rénard and Krebbs
  (1884), Wölfert (1897), Santos Dumont (1898-1905), Zeppelin (1900),
  Lebaudy (1903), Barton (English) (1905), Willows (English) (1910).</p>

  <p>In the meantime experimental work was being carried on by the
  exponents of the heavier-than-air school, who soon abandoned the
  flapping-wing principle and eventually evolved the modern aeroplane. The
  modern aeroplane was evolved from the brain of an Englishman, Sir George
  Cayley, who in 1809 contributed an article to <i>Nicholson's Journal</i>
  in which he outlined the outstretched wings, vertical and horizontal
  steering surfaces, screw-propeller, 'explosion' motor, and 'stream-line'
  form of the modern aeroplane. In 1842 Henson and Stringfellow, both
  Englishmen, constructed a steam-driven model on this principle, which is
  now in the South Kensington Museum. Wenham in 1866 contributed a valuable
  paper to the Royal Aeronautical Society on the subject. In 1896
  Lillienthal in Germany carried out a number of glides with rigid wings,
  provided with a movable tail, fixed to his body. He was followed by
  Chanute, who in America emphasized the biplane principle in his glider.
  In 1896 Ader, a Frenchman, built an 'avion' which is claimed to have
  risen from the ground at Satory, but this is doubtful. In 1895 a huge
  steam-propelled aeroplane built by Sir Hiram Maxim burst the rails
  holding it down and lifted for a few feet.</p>

    Wright's Biplane Glider
  </div>

  <p>The real credit for the evolution of a man-carrying aeroplane is,
  however, due to the American brothers Wilbur and Orville Wright of
  Dayton, Ohio. Encouraged by the <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page45"></a>[45]</span>advice of Chanute, they commenced
  experimenting with biplane gliders on the sand-hills at Kittyhawk.
  Meeting with considerable success, they fitted a petrol motor of their
  own design in 1903 and made several straight flights during the same
  year. In 1904 they succeeded in making the first turn in the air. These
  experiments were carried out in great secrecy, and it was not until 1908
  that their first public flights were made in France, the first taking
  place in October of that year. The first aviator to fly in Europe was
  Santos Dumont, who, on 12th Nov., 1906, covered 220 metres, having
  previously in the same year flown for shorter distances. At this time and
  during the two or three ensuing years many experiments were carried out,
  and flights made, by Farman, Voisin, Esnault-Pelterie, and Blériot in
  France; Wright and Curtiss in America; and Roe, Ogilvie, and
  Moore-Brabazon in England. A prize of £2000 offered by MM. Deutsch de la
  Meurthe and Ernest Archdeacon for the first circular flight over a
  distance of 1 kilometre, returning to the point of starting, was won in
  Jan., 1908, by Henry Farman.</p>

  <p>The second crossing of the Channel, and the first by a
  'heavier-than-air' machine, was effected by Louis Blériot in a machine of
  his own construction with an Anzani engine from Calais to Dover on 25th
  July, 1909. From that date the science of aviation (flight by
  heavier-than-air machines) may be said to have begun, and progress was
  merely a record of improvements. By the end of 1919 the Atlantic had been
  crossed four times; once by sea-plane, once by a non-stop aeroplane
  flight, and twice (outward and return) by non-stop air-ship flights.
  Aeroplanes had achieved a speed of 190 miles an hour, had attained to a
  height of over 34,000 feet, and had covered upwards of 1900 miles in one
  non-stop flight.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: De St. Fond,

  <p><b>Aeroplane,</b> a flying-machine deriving its power of sustentation
  from the reaction of the air driven downwards by the rapid transit of
  fixed wings or 'planes' through the air. The term 'plane' for the wing of
  an aeroplane is strictly a misnomer, as the word implies a flat plate,
  whereas a wing is 'cambered' or curved in section from front to back.
  This is due to the discovery of Lillienthal (see <i>Aeronautics</i>) that
  a cambered 'aerofoil' when set at an angle to a wind current gives more
  'lift' than a flat plane. The wing of an aeroplane is normally set at an
  angle horizontally (or rather at an angle to the relative wind) varying
  from 0° to 4°. This angle is known as the 'angle of incidence'. As the
  wing is driven through the air under the influence of the propeller, the
  air meets the 'leading' or 'entering' edge and is divided into two
  streams <!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page46"></a>[46]</span>along the top and bottom surfaces. It does
  not, however, follow the surface closely, but in the case of the lower
  stratum is deflected downwards at an angle to the surface, which results
  in an upward reaction. The upper of the two streams of air is
  correspondingly deflected upwards at an angle to the surface for a short
  distance. This causes an 'area of discontinuity of flow', or eddy, which
  results in 'negative pressure', causing an upward suction. This fact was
  first discovered by Sir Hiram Maxim, though it was G. Eiffel who measured
  the effects of the positive pressure on the lower surface and the
  negative pressure on the upper surface, and found, contrary to all
  expectation, that the latter is responsible for three-quarters of the
  total lifting effect of the wing. In addition to the lift, the wings
  offer resistance to progress through the air, which effect is known as
  'drag'. The ratio of lift to drag is a measure of the efficiency of a
  wing-section. A well-designed wing will have a L/D ratio at an angle of
  incidence of 4° of about 16, i.e. the lift effect in pounds will be 16
  times that of the drag. The fundamental equation of an aeroplane is R =
  KSV<sup>2</sup>, where R = the resistance, K = a constant (usually
  0.003), S = area of surface, and V = the velocity in feet per second.
  From this it will be seen that the resistance for the same area increases
  as the square of the speed, which shows the importance of reducing the
  resistance to the lowest possible degree if high speeds are to be
  obtained. For this purpose it is necessary that the flow of air round the
  component parts of the aeroplane caused by its passage should be as
  little disturbed and broken up into eddies as possible. It is found that
  the best theoretical shape for this purpose is a body of circular
  cross-section tapering from front to rear, with the maximum cross-section
  toward the <i>front</i>. The 'fineness ratio' (ratio of length to maximum
  diameter) should be about 6 to 1, and the maximum cross-section situated
  about one-third of the distance from the nose. Such a form will offer
  only about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> the resistance of a flat plate of
  similar cross-section, and is known as a 'stream-line form'. The width of
  a wing from side to side at right angles to the wind is known as the
  'span', and the breadth from front to back as the 'chord'. The ratio of
  span to chord is the 'aspect ratio'. Owing to the increase in drag
  resulting from low aspect ratio (large chord relative to span) the higher
  the aspect ratio the more efficient the wing. This is in practice about
  6, owing to structural difficulties in constructing a wing of larger
  relative span. The essential parts of an aeroplane are the wings,
  fuselage (body), tail (comprising fixed vertical and horizontal surfaces
  behind which are hinged movable rudders and elevators), and chassis, or
  landing-carriage. The majority of modern machines are biplanes, i.e. with
  one set of wings superposed on the other and connected by upright wooden
  members called 'struts'. Aeroplanes with one set of wings only are called
  'monoplanes'; those with three, 'triplanes'; with four, 'quadruplanes';
  and with more than four, 'multiplanes'. Aeroplanes are also divided into
  'tractor' and 'pusher', according to whether the propeller is situated in
  front or rear of the wings.</p>

  <p>When the engine is started, the revolution of the propeller causes the
  aeroplane to move along the ground until such a speed is reached (usually
  about 35-50 miles per hour) that it is able to support its own weight in
  the air when it leaves the ground. When in the air it is made to ascend
  or descend by moving the elevators, which are operated by a vertical
  stick in front of the pilot through control cables or levers. Steering to
  right or left is effected by the rudder, which is operated by a foot-bar
  through cables or levers. Lateral balance is obtained by means of
  'ailerons' or flaps on the outer extremities of the wings. If one wing
  tends to dip, the aileron on that side is depressed. This increases the
  resistance of that wing and so causes it to rise. By a combination of
  movements of the elevators, rudder, and ailerons almost any evolution can
  be performed with a modern aeroplane. A well-designed machine will, on
  cutting off the engine-power, turn its nose slightly down and
  automatically assume its own 'gliding-angle' to the ground. The
  gliding-angle is the ratio of descent to forward travel and is usually 1
  in 12 to 1 in 14.</p>

  <p>Speeds of 190 miles per hour have been attained and a height of 34,600
  feet reached. The greatest distance covered in one flight is the crossing
  of the Atlantic&mdash;slightly more than 1900 miles&mdash;while an
  aeroplane has remained in the air for 24 hours. Aeroplanes range in size
  from small single-seater 'scouts' with a duration of only some three
  hours, to large multiple-engined machines with a weight, fully loaded, of
  from 15 to 20 tons. The essential feature of the aeroplane is, as already
  stated, that it is heavier than air and therefore subject to the laws of
  gravity in the event of engine failure. Its choice of a landing-ground is
  then dependent upon its height at the moment and gliding-angle.</p>

  <p>Aeroplanes are normally constructed throughout of wood, though steel
  is occasionally used. The wings are built of wooden 'spars', of which
  there are usually two along the length of each wing, connected together
  by wooden 'ribs'. The wings of a biplane are braced by the struts (see
  above) and by wires. 'Landing-wires' support the weight of the wing on
  the ground, while 'flying-wires' prevent them folding upwards under the
  influence of the lift in flight. 'Drift-wires' are to prevent the wings
  folding <!-- Page 47 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page47"></a>[47]</span>backwards under the pressure of the air in
  flight. See also <i>Aeronautics</i>, <i>Sea-planes</i>.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Aerostatic Press,</b> a contrivance for extracting the colouring
  matter from dye-woods and for similar purposes. A liquid intended to
  carry with it the extract is brought into contact with the substance
  containing it, and a vacuum being made by an air-pump suitably applied,
  the pressure of the atmosphere forces the liquid through the intervening
  mass, carrying the colour or other soluble matter with it.</p>

  <p><b>Aerostat&prime;ics,</b> that branch of physics which treats of the
  weight, pressure, and equilibrium of air and gases. See <i>Air</i>;
  <i>Air-pump</i>; <i>Barometer</i>; <i>Gases, Properties of</i>;
  <i>Hydrostatics</i>; <i>Meteorology</i>; &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Aerotherapeutics</b> is the treatment of disease by atmospheres
  artificially prepared and differing from the normal in compression or
  pressure or temperature. It is divided into:</p>

  <p>1. <i>Medical atmospheres</i> artificially produced by changing the
  proportions of the normal gases of the atmosphere, or by adding gases to
  the atmosphere. These are applied by inhalation in various ways:</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) By the inhalation of gases&mdash;<i>ether</i>;
  <i>chloroform</i>; <i>nitrous oxide</i> (see <i>Anæsthetics</i>).
  <i>Oxygen</i> under pressure in a cylinder, with outlet applied close to
  the patient's mouth and nose, is used in severe cases of pneumonia,
  cardiac disease, or wherever breathing is difficult. <i>Amyl nitrate</i>
  is inhaled on the breaking of the glass capsules in which it is contained
  close to the patient's mouth; this treatment is used in cardiac disease
  and other conditions to recover blood pressure. <i>Chlorine</i> and
  <i>iodine</i> are used in cases of throat and bronchial affections by
  inhaling the vapour itself for a short time, or by inhaling air strongly
  impregnated with the substance.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) By inhalation of substances requiring heat for
  volatilization, e.g. <i>mercury</i> and <i>sulphur</i>. The patient,
  enveloped in a sheet, sits on a chair, while the substance, placed in a
  vessel on the floor inside the enveloping sheet near the patient, is
  heated by a spirit lamp or similar method. <i>Mercury</i> is used for
  chronic and syphilitic laryngitis and pharyngitis; <i>sulphur</i> for
  scabies and other skin diseases.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) By inhalation of steam or warm-water vapour with a drug
  added. Apparatus of various kinds is used, the simplest of which is a
  wide-mouthed jug filled with boiling water to which the drug has been
  added. The patient takes a deep breath, drawing the vapour into his mouth
  up a napkin arranged in the form of a tube. More complicated forms of
  apparatus are steam-sprays and nebulizers for laryngeal and bronchial
  troubles.</p>

  <p>(<i>d</i>) Cold medicated sprays and inhalations. Throat- and
  nose-sprays are much used, also sprays for the administration of local
  anæsthetics (ethyl chloride). Respirators are made of wire gauze with
  cotton wool or a sponge; the substance is poured on and inhaled by the
  patient.</p>

  <p>For (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) the following drugs are used: carbolic
  acid, creosote, terebine, thymol, eucalyptol, zinc sulphate, in phthisis
  and bronchial affections; and eusol, izal, lysol, &amp;c., for
  disinfection and fumigation.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Changes produced by variation in barometric pressure considered
  in treatment of disease</i>:</p>

  <p>Normal barometric pressure at sea-level, 29-30 inches; at Davos (5200
  feet), 25 inches; at summit of Pike's Peak, Colorado (14,000 feet), 17½
  inches; in balloon ascent (Glaisher and Coxwell) of 29,000 feet, 9¾
  inches.</p>

  <p>The effects of high pressure are seen in divers, caisson workers,
  miners. The effects of low pressure are seen in balloonists, airmen. The
  effect of sudden return to normal from high pressure is seen in cases of
  caisson disease (q.v.). The effects of low pressure were first applied to
  the human body in 1835 by V.T. Junot. He contrived a hollow copper ball,
  4 yards in diameter, capable of containing a man, and by pumping out air
  gradually, produced the effects of low pressure. This principle was then
  applied by him locally by cupping-glasses similar in shape to the upper
  part of a wineglass. There are two types of cupping:</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) In <i>wet cupping</i> an incision is made in the skin of
  the part to be treated. The air inside the glass is exhausted by
  introducing a lighted match, then the open end of the glass is
  immediately applied to the surface of the skin.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) In <i>dry cupping</i> the treatment is similarly carried
  out, but no incision is made.</p>

  <p>The low pressure (partial vacuum) draws blood to the part. Cupping is
  used in congestion of internal organs, e.g. lungs, kidneys.</p>

  <p>The artificial application of air to lungs at varying pressure is
  carried out by inspiring rarefied air or compressed air and expiring into
  rarefied air or into compressed air. Only inspiring compressed air, or
  expiring into rarefied air, can be practically applied. There are many
  kinds of apparatus for this. The best is the compressed-air bath (seen at
  Brompton Hospital, London), consisting of three parts&mdash;the engine,
  receiver, and air-chamber.</p>

  <p>The patient is placed in this air-chamber, where he remains for two
  hours, during which time the pressure is usually raised from half again
  to double normal. For the first half-hour the pressure is gradually
  raised, and is maintained <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page48"></a>[48]</span>at the same abnormal height for one hour;
  for the last half-hour it is reduced again gradually to normal. The
  patient first experiences an unpleasant sensation in the throat. This is
  relieved by swallowing or by drinking water; then pain in the ear-drums;
  the voice becomes shriller. These are early signs of the effects of high
  pressure, and are seen to a more marked degree in cases where a man has
  descended suddenly into a mine, caisson, &amp;c. Compressed air-baths are

  <p><b>Æschines</b> (es&prime;ki-n&#x113;z), a celebrated Athenian orator,
  the rival and opponent of Demosthenes, was born in 389 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> and died in 314. He headed the Macedonian party
  in Greece, or those in favour of an alliance with Philip, while
  Demosthenes took the opposite side. Having failed in 330 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> in a prosecution against Ctesiphon for proposing
  to bestow a crown of gold upon Demosthenes for his services to the State
  (whence the oration of Demosthenes 'On the Crown') he left Athens, and
  subsequently established a school of eloquence at Rhodes. Three of his
  orations are extant. Æschines should not be confounded with his namesake,

  distinction as a dramatist he had fought at the battle of Marathon (490),
  as he afterwards did at Artemisium, Salamis, and Platæa. He first gained
  the prize for tragedy in 484 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> <i>The

  to have gone to the Court of Hiero, King of Syracuse. Altogether he is
  reputed to have composed ninety plays and gained thirteen triumphs. Only
  seven of his tragedies are extant: <i>The Persians</i>, <i>Seven against
  Thebes</i>, <i>Suppliants</i>, <i>Prometheus</i>, <i>Agamemnon</i>,
  <i>Choephori</i>, and <i>Eumenides</i>, the last three forming a trilogy
  on the story of Orestes, represented in 458 <span

  tragedy, both from the splendour of his dramatic writings and from the
  scenic improvements and accessories he introduced. Till his time only one
  actor had appeared on the stage at a time, and by bringing on a second he
  was really the founder of dramatic dialogue. His style was grand, daring,
  and full of energy, and his choruses, though difficult, are among the
  noblest pieces of poetry in the world. His plays have little or no plot,
  and his characters are drawn by a few powerful strokes. There are English
  poetical translations of his plays by Blackie, Plumptre, Swanwick,
  Campbell, Robert Browning, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.&mdash;<span

  worshipped in particular at Epidaurus, in the Peloponnesus, where a
  temple with a grove was dedicated to him. The sick who visited his temple
  had to spend one or more nights in the sanctuary, after which the
  remedies to be used were revealed in a dream. Those who were cured
  offered a sacrifice to Æsculapius, commonly a cock. He is often
  represented with a large beard, holding a knotty staff, round which is
  entwined a serpent, the serpent being specially his symbol. The staff and
  serpent have been adopted as a badge by the Royal Army Medical Corps.

  so little is known of his life that his existence has been called in
  question. He is said to have been originally a slave, and to have
  received his freedom from a Samian master, Iadmon. He then visited the
  court of Cr&oelig;sus, and is also said to have visited Pisistratus at
  Athens. Finally he was sent by Cr&oelig;sus to Delphi to distribute a sum
  of money to each of the citizens. For some reason he refused to
  distribute the money, whereupon the Delphians, enraged, threw him from a
  precipice and killed him. No works of Æsop are extant, and it is doubtful
  whether he wrote any. Bentley <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  were delivered orally and perpetuated by repetition. Such fables are
  spoken of both by Aristophanes and Plato. Phædrus turned into Latin verse
  the Æsopian fables current in his day, with additions of his own. In
  modern times several collections claiming to be Æsop's fables have been
  published. Cf. J. Jacobs, <i>The Fables of Æsop</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Æsthet&prime;ics</b> (Gr. <i>aisth&#x113;tikos</i>, pertaining to
  perception), the philosophy of the beautiful; the name given to the
  branch of philosophy or of science which is concerned with that class of
  emotions, or with those attributes, real or apparent, of objects
  generally comprehended under the term <i>beauty</i>, and other related
  expressions. The term æsthetics first received this application from
  Baumgarten (1714-62), a German philosopher, who was the first modern
  writer to deal systematically with the subject, though the beautiful had
  received attention at the hands of philosophers from early times.
  Socrates, according to Xenophon, regarded the beautiful as coincident
  with the good, and both as resolvable into the useful. Plato, in
  accordance with his idealistic theory, held the existence of an absolute
  beauty, which is the ground of beauty in all things. He also asserted the
  intimate union of the good, the beautiful, and the true. Aristotle
  treated of the subject in much more detail than Plato, but chiefly from
  the scientific or critical point of view. In his treatises on
  <i>Poetics</i> and <i>Rhetoric</i> he lays down a theory of art, and
  establishes principles of beauty. His philosophical views were in many
  respects opposed to those of Plato. He does not admit an absolute
  conception of the beautiful; but he distinguishes beauty from the good,
  the useful, the fit, and the necessary. He resolves beauty into certain
  elements, as order, symmetry, definiteness. A distinction of beauty,
  according to him, is the absence of lust or desire in the pleasure it
  excites. Beauty has no utilitarian or ethical object; the aim of art is
  merely to give immediate pleasure; its essence is imitation. Plotinus
  agrees with Plato, and disagrees with Aristotle, in holding that beauty
  may subsist in single and simple objects, and consequently in restoring
  the absolute conception of beauty. He differs from Plato and Aristotle in
  raising art above nature. Baumgarten's treatment of æsthetics is
  essentially Platonic. He made the division of philosophy into logic,
  ethics, and æsthetics; the first dealing with knowledge, the second with
  action (will and desire), the third with beauty. He limits æsthetics to
  the conceptions derived from the senses, and makes them consist in
  confused or obscured conceptions, in contradistinction to logical
  knowledge, which consists in clear conceptions. Kant, in his <i>Critique
  of the Power of Judgment</i>, defines beauty in reference to his four
  categories, quantity, quality, relation, and modality. In accordance with
  the subjective character of his system he denies an absolute conception
  of beauty, but his detailed treatment of the subject is inconsistent with
  the denial. Thus he attributes a beauty to single colours and tones, not
  on any plea of complexity, but on the ground of purity. He holds also
  that the highest meaning of beauty is to symbolize moral good, and
  arbitrarily attaches moral characters to the seven primary colours. The
  value of art is mediate, and the beauty of art is inferior to that of
  nature. The treatment of beauty in the systems of Schelling and Hegel
  could with difficulty be made comprehensible without a detailed reference
  to the principles of these remarkable speculations. English writers on
  beauty are numerous, but they rarely ascend to the heights of German
  speculation. Shaftesbury adopted the notion that beauty is perceived by a
  special internal sense; in which he was followed by Hutcheson, who held
  that beauty existed only in the perceiving mind, and not in the object.
  Numerous English writers, among whom the principal are Alison and
  Jeffrey, have supported the theory that the source of beauty is to be
  found in association&mdash;a theory analogous to that which places
  morality in sympathy. The ability of its supporters gave this view a
  temporary popularity, but its baselessness has been effectively exposed
  by successive critics. Dugald Stewart attempted to show that there is no
  common quality in the beautiful beyond that of producing a certain
  refined pleasure; and Bain agrees with this criticism, but endeavours to
  restrict the beautiful within a group of emotions chiefly excited by
  association or combination of simpler elementary feelings. Herbert
  Spencer has a theory of beauty which is subservient to the theory of
  evolution. He makes beauty consist in the play of the higher powers of
  perception and emotion, defined as an activity not directly subservient
  to any processes conducive to life, but being gratifications sought for
  themselves alone. He classifies æsthetic pleasures according to the
  complexity of the emotions excited, or the number of powers duly
  exercised; and he attributes the depth and apparent vagueness of musical
  emotions to associations with vocal tones built up during vast ages.
  Among numerous writers who have made valuable contributions to the
  scientific discussion of æsthetics may be mentioned Winckelmann, Lessing,
  Richter, the Schlegels, Gervinus, Helmholtz, Ruskin, Home, Hogarth,
  Burke, Taine, and others.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>:

  <p><b>Affida&prime;vit,</b> a written statement of facts upon oath or
  affirmation. Affidavits are generally made use of when evidence is to be
  laid before a judge or a court, while evidence brought before a jury is
  delivered orally. The person making the affidavit signs his name at the
  bottom of it, and swears that the statements contained in it are true.
  The affidavit may be sworn to in open court, or before a magistrate or
  other duly qualified person; it may be made abroad before a qualified
  British state official.</p>

  <p><b>Affin&prime;ity,</b> in chemistry, the force by which unlike kinds
  of matter combine so intimately that the properties of the constituents
  are lost, and a compound with new properties is produced. Of the force
  itself we know little or nothing. It is not the same under all
  conditions, being very much modified by circumstances, especially
  temperature. The usual effect of increase of temperature is to diminish
  affinity and ultimately to cause the separation of a compound into its
  constituents; and there is probably for every compound a temperature
  above which it could not exist, but would be broken up. Where two
  elements combine to form a compound, heat is almost always evolved, and
  the amount evolved serves as a measure of the affinity. In order that
  chemical affinity may come into play it is necessary that the substances
  should be in contact, and usually one of them at least is a fluid or a
  gas. The results produced by chemical combination are endlessly varied.
  Colour, taste, and smell are changed, destroyed, or created; harmless
  constituents produce strong poisons, strong poisons produce harmless
  compounds.</p>

  <p><b>Affinity,</b> in law, is that degree of connection which subsists
  between one of two married persons and the blood relations of the other.
  It is no real kindred (consanguinity). A person cannot, by legal
  succession, receive an inheritance from a relation by affinity; neither
  does it extend to the nearest relations of husband and wife so as to
  create a mutual relation between them. The degrees of affinity are
  computed in the same way as those of consanguinity or blood. All legal
  impediments arising from affinity cease upon the death of the husband or
  wife, excepting those which relate to the marriage of the survivor.</p>

  <p><b>Affirma&prime;tion,</b> a solemn declaration by Quakers, Moravians,
  Dunkers, and others, who object to taking an oath, in confirmation of
  their testimony in courts of law, or of their statements on other
  occasions on which the sanction of an oath is required of other persons.
  In England the form for Quakers is, 'I do solemnly, sincerely, and truly
  declare and affirm'. Affirmation is generally allowed to be substituted
  for an oath in all cases where a person refuses to take an oath from
  conscientious motives, if the judge is satisfied that the motives are
  conscientious. False affirmation is subjected to the same penalties as
  perjury.</p>

  <p><b>Affreightment</b> means the contract of carriage of goods by sea,
  by which the shipowner <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page51"></a>[51]</span>undertakes to carry goods in his ship for
  hire or <i>freight</i>. Unless otherwise stipulated, the merchant or
  freighter is only bound to pay the freight upon delivery of the goods at
  the agreed destination. If the voyage is abandoned, the merchant may
  claim his goods without any payment. The merchant must load and discharge
  his cargo within the <i>lay-days</i> or stipulated time, if any;
  otherwise within a reasonable time. Failure entails liability in
  damages&mdash;known as <i>demurrage</i>&mdash;for undue detention of the
  ship. The merchant will also be liable in damages&mdash;known as
  <i>dead-freight</i>&mdash;if he fails to furnish the full cargo promised.
  The shipowner has a lien on the goods for their own freight and charges,
  but not for a general balance. Nor has he any lien for dead-freight or
  demurrage. All such liens may be validly stipulated for in the contract.
  They are purely possessory as contrasted with the so-called maritime
  liens for seamen's and shipmasters' wages, which are valid without
  possession. There is no lien for <i>advance freight</i>, which in
  Scotland is repayable if the cargo is lost at sea or delivery otherwise
  prevented, but not so in England. In Scotland, accordingly, the burden of
  insuring advance freight falls upon the shipowner, in England upon the
  merchant.</p>

  <p>The main obligations upon the shipowner are to provide a seaworthy
  vessel, carry without undue delay, and deliver the goods in the same
  condition as they were shipped. Unless otherwise agreed, he is liable for
  damage or loss through negligence, and if he be a common carrier, as he
  frequently is, even the absence of negligence may not save him. There is
  nothing in British law, however, to prevent him from contracting out of
  all responsibility for the safety of goods committed to his care, and he
  generally does so, either by inserting what is known as an 'exception
  clause' in the document evidencing the contract, viz. the Bill of Lading,
  or by giving public notice that he only accepts goods upon that footing.
  In this respect the position of shipowners is more favourable than that
  of railway companies and other land carriers, whose freedom of contract
  is curtailed by statute.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>:

  <p><b>Afghanistan</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>f-gän&prime;i-stän), that is, the land of
  the Afghans, a country in Asia, bounded on the east by the N.&nbsp;W. Frontier
  Province, &amp;c., on the south by Baluchistan, on the west by the
  Persian province of Khorasan, and on the north by Bukhara and Russian
  Turkestan. The eastern and southern boundaries were settled in 1893,
  whilst the boundary towards Persia was demarcated between March, 1903,
  and May, 1905. The area may be set down at about 250,000 sq. miles. The
  population is estimated at 6,000,000. Afghanistan consists chiefly of
  lofty, bare, uninhabited tablelands, sandy barren plains, ranges of
  snow-covered mountains, offsets of the Hindu Kush or the Himálaya, and
  deep ravines and valleys. Many of the last are well watered and very
  fertile, but about four-fifths of the whole surface is rocky,
  mountainous, and unproductive. The surface on the north-east is covered
  with lofty ranges belonging to the Hindu Kush, whose heights are often
  18,000 and sometimes reach perhaps 25,000 feet. The whole north-eastern
  portion of the country has a general elevation of over 6000 feet; but
  towards the south-west, in which direction the principal mountain chains
  of the interior run, the general elevation declines to not more than 1600
  feet. In the interior the mountains sometimes reach the height of 15,000
  feet. Great part of the frontier towards India consists of the Suleiman
  range, 12,000 feet high. There are numerous practicable avenues of
  communication between Afghanistan and India, among the most extensively
  used being the famous Khyber Pass, by which the River Kabul enters the
  Punjab; the Gomul Pass, also leading to the Punjab; and the Bolan Pass on
  the south, through which the route passes to Sind. Of the rivers the
  largest is the Helmund, which flows in a south-westerly direction more
  than 400 miles, till it enters the Hamoon or Seistan swamp. It receives
  the Arghandab, a considerable stream. Next in importance are the Kabul in
  the north-east, which drains to the Indus, and the Hari Rud in the
  north-west, which, like other Afghan streams, loses itself in the sand.
  The climate is extremely cold in the higher, and intensely hot in the
  lower regions, yet on the whole it is salubrious. The most common trees
  are the pine, oak, birch, and walnut. In the valleys fruits, in the
  greatest variety and abundance, grow wild. The principal crops are wheat
  (forming the staple food of the people), barley, rice, and maize. Other
  crops are tobacco, sugar-cane, and cotton. The chief domestic animals are
  the dromedary, the horse, ass, and mule, the ox, sheep with large fine
  fleeces and enormous fat tails, and goats; of wild animals there are the
  tiger, bears, leopards, wolves, jackal, hyena, foxes, &amp;c. The chief
  towns are Kabul (the capital), Kandahar, Ghuzni, and Herat. The
  inhabitants belong to different races, but the Afghans proper form the
  great mass of the people. They are allied in blood to the Persians, and
  are divided into a number of tribes, among which the Duranis and Ghiljis
  are the most important. The Afghans, claiming descent from King Saul, are
  called by their own ancient chroniclers Beni-Israel. They are bold,
  hardy, and warlike, fond of freedom and resolute in maintaining it, but
  of a restless, turbulent temper, and much given <!-- Page 52 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>[52]</span>to plunder. Tribal
  dissensions are constantly in existence, and seldom or never do all the
  Afghans pay allegiance to the nominal ruler of their country. Their
  language (Pushtu) is distinct from the Persian, though it contains a
  great number of Persian words, and is written, like the Persian, with the
  Arabic characters. In religion they are Mahommedans of the Sunnite
  sect.</p>

  <p>After having been subjugated by Alexander the Great, the country of
  the Afghans fell successively under the sway, actual or nominal, of
  Parthians, Seleucidæ, Persians, and Arabs. Djinghiz Khan conquered
  Afghanistan in the twelfth century and Timur in the fourteenth. In 1504
  Sultan Baber took Cabul and founded the Mogul dynasty in India;
  Afghanistan thus formed part of the great empire of Delhi. In 1738 the
  country was conquered by the Persians under Nadir Shah. On his death in
  1747 Ahmed Shah, one of his generals, obtained the sovereignty of
  Afghanistan, and became the founder of a dynasty which lasted about
  eighty years. At the end of that time Dost Mohammed, the ruler of Cabul,
  had acquired a preponderating influence in the country. On account of his
  dealings with the Russians the British resolved to dethrone him and
  restore Shah Shuja, a former ruler. In April, 1839, a British army under
  Sir John Keane entered Afghanistan, occupied Cabul, and placed Shah Shuja
  on the throne, a force of 8000 being left to support the new sovereign.
  Sir W. Macnaghten remained as envoy at Cabul, with Sir Alexander Burnes
  as assistant envoy. The Afghans soon organized a widespread insurrection,
  which came to a head on 2nd Nov., 1841, when Burnes and a number of
  British officers, besides women and children, were murdered, Macnaghten
  being murdered not long after. The other British leaders now made a
  treaty with the Afghans, at whose head was Akbar, son of Dost Mohammed,
  agreeing to withdraw the forces from the country, while the Afghans were
  to furnish them with provisions and escort them on their way. On 6th
  Jan., 1842, the British left Cabul and began their most disastrous
  retreat. The cold was intense, they had almost no food&mdash;for the
  treacherous Afghans did not fulfil their promises&mdash;and day after day
  they were assailed by bodies of the enemy. By the 13th 26,000 persons,
  including camp-followers, women and children, were destroyed. Some were
  kept as prisoners, but only one man, Dr. Brydon, reached Jelalabad,
  which, as well as Kandahar, was still held by British troops. In a few
  months General Pollock, with a fresh army from India, retook Cabul and
  soon finished the war. Shah Shuja having been assassinated, Dost Mohammed
  again obtained the throne of Cabul, and acquired extensive power in
  Afghanistan. He joined with the Sikhs against the British, but afterwards
  made an offensive and defensive alliance with the latter. He died in
  1863, having nominated his son Shere Ali his successor. Shere Ali entered
  into friendly relations with the British, but in 1878, having repulsed a
  British envoy and refused to receive a British mission (a Russian mission
  being meantime at his Court), war was declared against him, and the
  British troops entered Afghanistan. They met with comparatively little
  resistance; the Ameer fled to Turkestan, where he soon after died; and
  his son Yakoob Khan having succeeded him concluded a treaty with the
  British (at Gandamak, May, 1879), in which a certain extension of the
  British frontier, the control by Britain of the foreign policy of
  Afghanistan, and the residence of a British envoy in Cabul, were the
  chief stipulations. Not long after this settlement, the British resident
  at Cabul, Sir Louis P. Cavagnari, and the other members of the mission
  were treacherously attacked and slain by the Afghans, and troops had
  again to be sent into the country. Cabul was again occupied, and Kandahar
  and Ghazni were also relieved; while Yakoob Khan was sent to imprisonment
  in India. In 1880 Abdur-Rahman, a grandson of Dost Mohammed, was
  recognized by Britain as ameer of the country. He was on friendly terms
  with the British during his reign, which ended with his death in 1901,
  his son Habibullah being his successor. He had adopted the title of
  Sirajul-Millat wa ud-din, 'Lamp of the Nation and Religion'. In a treaty
  signed on 21st March, 1905, the Ameer recognized the engagements which
  his father had entered into with the British Government. Encroachments by
  the Russians on territory claimed by Afghanistan almost brought about a
  rupture between Britain and Russia in 1885, and led to the delimitation
  of the frontier of Afghanistan on the side next Russia. On 31st Aug.,
  1907, an Anglo-Russian Convention relating to Afghanistan was signed. The
  Russian Government recognized Afghanistan as outside the Russian sphere
  of influence, whilst Great Britain undertook neither to annex nor occupy
  any portion of Afghanistan. In spite of German intrigues, the Ameer
  refused, in 1915, the inducements held out to him to abandon his British
  ally. He was assassinated on 20th Feb., 1919, and was succeeded by his
  third son Amanullah. The new Ameer sought to gain popularity with his
  subjects by embarking on an unprovoked war of aggression upon India.
  Hostilities broke out in May, 1919, and ended with a peace treaty signed
  at Rawalpindi on 8th Aug., 1919. In 1922 the first Afghan minister was
  appointed to London (instead of to Delhi).&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Af&prime;rica,</b> one of the three great divisions of the Old
  World, and the second in extent of the five principal continents of the
  globe, forming a vast peninsula joined to Asia by the Isthmus of Suez. It
  is of a compact form, with few important projections or indentations, and
  having therefore a very small extent of coast-line (about 16,000 miles,
  or much less than that of Europe) in proportion to its area. This
  continent extends from 37° 21&prime; <span class="scac">N.</span> lat. to
  34° 51&prime; <span class="scac">S.</span> lat., and the extreme points,
  Cape Blanco and Cape Agulhas, are nearly 5000 miles apart. From west to
  east, between Cape Verde, lon. 17° 34&prime; <span
  class="scac">W.</span>, and Cape Guardafui, lon. 51° 16&prime; <span
  class="scac">E.</span>, the distance is about 4600 miles. The area is
  estimated at 11,500,000 sq. miles, or more than three times that of
  Europe. The islands belonging to Africa are not numerous, and, except
  Madagascar, none of them are large. They include Madeira, the Canaries,
  Cape Verde Islands, Fernando Po, Principe, São Thomé, Ascension, St.
  Helena, Mauritius, Réunion, the Comoros, Socotra, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The interior of Africa is as yet imperfectly known, but we know enough
  of the continent as a whole to be able to point to some general features
  that characterize it. One of these is that almost all round it at no
  great distance from the sea, and, roughly speaking, parallel with the
  coast-line, we find ranges of mountains or elevated lands forming the
  outer edges of interior plateaux. The most striking feature of Northern
  Africa is the immense tract known as the Sahara or Great Desert, which is
  enclosed on the north by the Atlas Mountains (greatest height, 12,000 to
  15,000 feet), the plateau of Barbary and that of Barqa, on the east by
  the mountains along the west coast of the Red Sea, on the west by the
  Atlantic Ocean, and on the south by the Sudan. The Sahara is by no means
  the sea of sand it has sometimes been represented: it contains elevated
  plateaux and even mountains radiating in all directions, with habitable
  valleys between. A considerable nomadic population is scattered over the
  habitable parts, and in the more favoured regions there are settled
  communities. The Sudan, which lies to the south of the Sahara, and
  separates it from the more elevated plateau of Southern Africa, forms a
  belt of pastoral country across Africa, and includes the countries on the
  Niger, around Lake Tchad (or Chad), and eastwards to the elevated region
  of Abyssinia. Southern Africa as a whole is much more fertile and well
  watered than Northern Africa, though it also has a desert tract of
  considerable extent (the Kalahari Desert). This division of the continent
  consists of a tableland, or series of tablelands, of considerable
  elevation and great diversity of surface, exhibiting hollows filled with
  great lakes, and terraces over which the rivers break in falls and
  rapids, as they find their way to the low-lying coast tracts. The
  mountains which enclose Southern Africa are mostly much higher on the
  east than on the west, the most northerly of the former being those of
  Abyssinia, with heights of 10,000 to 14,000 or 16,000 feet, while the
  eastern edge of the Abyssinian plateau presents a steep unbroken line of
  7000 feet in height for many hundred miles. Farther south, and between
  the great lakes and the Indian Ocean, we find Mounts Kenya and
  Kilimanjaro (19,500 feet), the loftiest in Africa, covered with perpetual
  snow. Of the continuation of this mountain boundary we shall only mention
  the Drakenberg Mountains, which stretch to the southern extremity of the
  continent, reaching, in Cathkin Peak, Natal, the height of over 10,000
  feet. Of the mountains that form the western border the highest are the
  Cameroon Mountains, which rise to a height of 13,000 feet at the inner
  angle of the Gulf of Guinea. The average elevation of the southern
  plateau is from 3000 to 4000 feet.</p>

  <p>The Nile is the only great river of Africa which flows into the
  Mediterranean. It receives its waters primarily from the great lake
  Victoria Nyanza, which lies under the equator, and in its upper course is
  fed by tributary streams of great size, but for the last 1200 miles of
  its course it has not a single affluent. It drains an area of more than
  1,000,000 sq. miles. The Indian Ocean receives numerous rivers; but the
  only great river of South Africa which enters that ocean is the Zambezi,
  the fourth in size of the continent, and having in its course the
  Victoria Falls, one of the greatest waterfalls in the world. In Southern
  Africa also, but flowing westward and entering the Atlantic, is the
  Congo, which takes its origin from a series of lakes and marshes in the
  interior, is fed by great tributaries, and is the first in volume of all
  the African rivers, carrying to the ocean more water than the
  Mississippi. Unlike most of the African rivers, the mouth of the Congo
  forms an estuary. Of the other Atlantic rivers, the Senegal, the Gambia,
  and the Niger are the largest, the last being third among African
  streams. <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>[54]</span></p>

  <p>With the exception of Lake Tchad there are no great lakes in the
  northern division of Africa, whereas in the number and magnificence of
  its lakes the southern division almost rivals North America. Here are the
  Victoria and Albert Nyanza, Lakes Tanganyika, Nyasa, Shirwa, Bangweulu,
  Moero, and other lakes. Of these the Victoria and Albert belong to the
  basin of the Nile; Tanganyika, Bangweulu, and Moero to that of the Congo;
  Nyasa, by its affluent the Shiré, to the Zambezi. Lake Tchad on the
  borders of the northern desert region is now known to be much smaller
  than was formerly believed, but varies in area according to the season.
  Lake Ngami in the far south is now a mere swamp.</p>

  <p>The climate of Africa is mainly influenced by the fact that it lies
  almost entirely within the tropics. In the equatorial belt, both north
  and south, rain is abundant and vegetation very luxuriant, dense tropical
  forests prevailing for about 10° on either side of the line. To the north
  and south of the equatorial belt the rainfall diminishes, and the forest
  region is succeeded by an open pastoral and agricultural country. This is
  followed by the rainless regions of the Sahara on the north and the
  Kalahari Desert on the south, extending beyond the tropics, and bordering
  on the agricultural and pastoral countries of the north and south coasts,
  which lie entirely in the temperate zone. The low coast regions of Africa
  are almost everywhere unhealthy, the Atlantic coast within the tropics
  being the most fatal region to Europeans.</p>

  <p>Among mineral productions may be mentioned gold, which is found in the
  rivers of West Africa (hence the name Gold Coast), and in Southern
  Africa, most abundantly in the Transvaal; diamonds have been found in
  large numbers in recent years in the south; iron, copper, lead, tin, and
  coal are also found.&mdash;Among plants are the baobab, the date-palm
  (important as a food plant in the north), the doum-palm, the oil-palm,
  the wax-palm, the shea-butter tree, trees yielding caoutchouc, the
  papyrus, the castor-oil plant, indigo, the coffee-plant, heaths with
  beautiful flowers, aloes, &amp;c. Among cultivated plants are wheat,
  maize, millet, and other grains, cotton, coffee, cassava, ground-nut,
  yam, banana, tobacco, various fruits, &amp;c. As regards both plants and
  animals, Northern Africa, adjoining the Mediterranean, is distinguished
  from the rest of Africa in its great agreement with Southern
  Europe.&mdash;Among the most characteristic African animals are the lion,
  hyena, jackal, gorilla, chimpanzee, baboon, African elephant (never
  domesticated, yielding much ivory to trade), hippopotamus, rhinoceros,
  giraffe, zebra, quagga, antelopes in great variety and immense
  numbers.&mdash;Among birds are the ostrich, the secretary-bird or
  serpent-eater, the honey-guide cuckoo, sacred ibis, guinea
  fowl.&mdash;The reptiles include the crocodile, chameleon, and serpents
  of various kinds, some of them very venomous. Among insects are locusts,
  scorpions, the tsetse-fly whose bite is so fatal to cattle, and
  white-ants.</p>

  <p>The great races of which the population of Africa mainly consists are
  the Eastern Hamites (who are not a distinct race but a blend), the
  Semites, the Negroes, and the Bantus. To the Semitic stock belong the
  Arabs, who form a considerable portion of the population in Egypt and
  along the north coast, while a portion of the inhabitants of Abyssinia is
  of the same race. The Hamites are represented, according to Sergi, by the
  Copts of Egypt, the Berbers, Kabyles, &amp;c., of Northern Africa, and
  the Somâli, Danâkil, &amp;c., of East Africa. The Negro races occupy a
  vast territory in the Sudan and Central Africa, while the Bantus occupy
  the greater part of Southern Africa from a short distance north of the
  equator, and include the Kaffirs, Bechuanas, Swahili, and allied races.
  In the extreme south-west are the Hottentots and Bushmen (the latter a
  dwarfish race), distinct from the other races as well as, probably, from
  each other. In Madagascar there is a large Malay element. To these may be
  added the Fulahs on the Niger and the Nubians on the Nile and elsewhere,
  who are of a brownish colour, and are often regarded as distinct from the
  other races, though sometimes classed with the Negroes. In religion a
  great proportion of the inhabitants are heathens of the lowest type;
  Mohammedanism numbers a large number of adherents in North Africa, and is
  rapidly spreading in the Sudan; Christianity prevails only among the
  Copts, the Abyssinians, and the natives of Madagascar, the last-named
  having been converted in recent times. Elsewhere the missionaries seem to
  have made but little progress. Over a great part of the continent
  civilization is at a low ebb, yet in some parts the natives have shown
  considerable skill in agriculture and various mechanical arts, as in
  weaving and metal working. Of African trade two features are the caravans
  that traverse great distances, and the trade in slaves that still widely
  prevails, though it has been greatly restricted in recent years. Among
  articles exported from Africa are palm-oil, diamonds, ivory, ostrich
  feathers, wool, cotton, gold, esparto, caoutchouc, &amp;c. The population
  is estimated at 180,000,000. Of these a small number are of European
  origin&mdash;French in Algeria and Morocco, British and Dutch at the
  southern extremity.</p>

  <p>Great areas in Africa have been apportioned among European Powers as
  protectorates or spheres of influence. Among native States still more or
  less independent are Egypt, Abyssinia, Waday, Bagirmi, Liberia. To
  Britain belong the Cape Province, Natal, the Orange Free State and
  Transvaal, with Rhodesia, <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page55"></a>[55]</span>&amp;c., farther north, a region in Eastern
  Africa extending from the sea to Lake Victoria and the headwaters of the
  Nile, Nigeria, Gold Coast, and other tracts on the west, with Mauritius,
  &amp;c.; to France belong Algeria and Tunis, Senegambia, Zone of Morocco,
  territory north of the Lower Congo, Madagascar, &amp;c.; the Portuguese
  possess Angola on the west coast and Mozambique on the east; Italy has a
  territory on the Red Sea, and part of Somaliland; Spain has a part of the
  coast of the Sahara; the Congo State is a colony of Belgium; Zanzibar is
  merged in Kenya Colony. Germany was deprived of her possessions in Africa
  during the European War, and the Peace Conference of 1919 appointed Great
  Britain, France, and Belgium to act as mandatories of the League of
  Nations.</p>

  <p>The name Africa was given by the Romans at first only to a small
  district in the immediate neighbourhood of Carthage. The Greeks called
  Africa Libya, and the Romans often used the same name. The first African
  exploring expedition on record was sent by Pharaoh Necho about the end of
  the seventh century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> to circumnavigate the
  continent. The navigators, who were Ph&oelig;nicians, were absent three
  years, and according to report they accomplished their object. Fifty or a
  hundred years later, Hanno, a Carthaginian, made a voyage down the west
  coast and seems to have got as far as the Bight of Benin. The east coast
  was probably known to the ancients as far as Mozambique and the island of
  Madagascar. Of modern nations the Portuguese were the first to take in
  hand the exploration of Africa. In 1433 they doubled Cape Bojador, in
  1441 reached Cape Blanco, in 1442 Cape Verde, in 1462 they discovered
  Sierra Leone. In 1484 the Portuguese Diego Cam discovered the mouth of
  the Congo. In 1486 Bartholomew Diaz rounded the Cape of Good Hope and
  reached Algoa Bay. A few years later a Portuguese traveller visited
  Abyssinia. In 1497 Vasco da Gama, who was commissioned to find a route by
  sea to India, sailed round the southern extremity as far as Zanzibar,
  discovering Natal on his way. The first European settlements were those
  of the Portuguese in Angola and Mozambique, soon after 1500. In 1650 the
  Dutch made a settlement at the Cape. In 1770 James Bruce reached the
  source of the Blue Nile in Abyssinia. For the exploration of the interior
  of Africa, however, little was done before the close of the eighteenth
  century.</p>

  <p>Modern African exploration may be said to begin with Mungo Park, who
  reached the upper course of the Niger (1795-1805). Dr. Lacerda, a
  Portuguese, about the same time reached the capital of the Cazembe, in
  the centre of South Africa, where he died. During 1802-6 two Portuguese
  traders crossed the continent from Angola, through the Cazembe's
  dominions, to the Portuguese possessions on the Zambezi. During 1822-4
  extensive explorations were made in Northern and Western Africa by
  Denham, Clapperton, and Oudney, who proceeded from Tripoli by Murzuq to
  Lake Tchad, and explored the adjacent regions; Laing, in 1826, crossed
  the desert from Tripoli to Timbuktu; Caillié, leaving Senegal, made in
  1827-8 a journey to Timbuktu, and thence through the desert to Morocco.
  In 1830 Lander traced a large part of the course of the Niger downward to
  its mouth, discovering its tributary the Benue. In the south Livingstone,
  who was stationed as a missionary at Kolobeng, setting out from that
  place in 1849 discovered Lake Ngami. In 1851 he went north again, and
  came upon numerous rivers flowing north, affluents of the Zambezi. In
  1848 and 1849 Krapf and Rebmann, missionaries in East Africa, discovered
  the mountains Kilimanjaro and Kenya. An expedition sent out by the
  British Government started from Tripoli in 1850 to visit the Sahara and
  the regions around Lake Tchad, the chiefs being Richardson, Overweg, and
  Barth. The last alone returned in 1855, having carried his explorations
  over 2,000,000 sq. miles of this part of Africa, hitherto almost unknown.
  During 1853-6 Livingstone made an important series of explorations. He
  first went north-westwards, tracing part of the Upper Zambezi, and
  reached St. Paul de Loanda on the west coast in 1854. On his return
  journey he followed pretty nearly the same route till he reached the
  Zambezi, and proceeding down the river, and visiting its falls, called by
  him the Victoria Falls, he arrived at Quelimane at its mouth on 20th May,
  1856, thus crossing the continent from sea to sea. In 1858 he resumed his
  exploration of the Zambezi regions, and in various journeys visited Lakes
  Shirwa and Nyasa, sailed up the Shiré to the latter lake, and established
  the general features of the geography of this part of Africa, returning
  to England in 1864. By this time the great lakes of equatorial Africa
  were becoming known, Tanganyika and Victoria having been discovered by
  Burton and Speke in 1858, and the latter having been visited by Speke and
  Grant in 1862 and found to give rise to the Nile, while the Albert Nyanza
  was discovered by Baker in 1864. In 1866 Livingstone entered on his last
  great series of explorations, the main object of which was to settle the
  position of the watersheds in the interior of the continent, and which he
  carried on till his death in 1873. His most important explorations on
  this occasion were west and south-west of Tanganyika, including the
  discovery of Lakes Bangweulu and Moero, and part of the upper course of
  the River Congo (here called Lualaba). For over two years he <!-- Page 56
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>[56]</span>was lost to the
  knowledge of Europe till met with by H.&nbsp;M. Stanley at Tanganyika in 1871.
  Gerhard Rohlfs, in a succession of journeys from 1861 to 1874, traversed
  the Sahara in different directions, and also crossed the continent
  entirely from Tripoli to Lagos by way of Murzuq, Bornu, &amp;c. During
  1873-5 Lieutenant Cameron, who had been sent in search of Livingstone,
  surveyed Lake Tanganyika, explored the country to the west of it, and
  then travelling to the south-west, finally reached Benguella on the
  Atlantic coast. During 1874-7 Stanley surveyed Lakes Victoria Nyanza and
  Tanganyika and explored the intervening country; then going westward to
  where Livingstone had struck the Congo he followed the river down to its
  mouth, thus finally settling its course and completing a remarkable and
  valuable series of explorations. In 1879 Serpa Pinto completed a journey
  across the continent from Benguella to Natal, and in 1881-2 Wissman and
  Pogge crossed it again from St. Paul de Loanda to Zanzibar. In recent
  years our knowledge of all parts of Africa has been greatly increased,
  thanks to the efforts of travellers, missionaries, and commercial agents.
  Steamers now ply on the Congo, and on Lakes Tanganyika, Nyasa, and
  Victoria, and numerous railways ('Cape to Cairo', &amp;c.) extend far
  into the continent.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Mungo

  <p><b>Afridis</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>-fr&#x113;&prime;diz), a tribe or clan on
  the north-west frontier of India, about the Khyber Pass, who have at
  various times given trouble to the British, and are included in a new
  (1922) scheme of Khassadars (irregulars). In 1897-8 a campaign ('the
  Tirah campaign') had to be undertaken against them, costly both in men
  and money, before British authority was asserted. In 1905 the Afridis of
  the force called the Khyber Rifles formed an escort for the Prince and
  Princess of Wales on their visit to the famous pass, which was long in
  their charge.&mdash;Cf. Holdich, <i>The Indian Borderland</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Afrikander Bund,</b> an association dating from 1880 and founded
  for the purpose of consolidating Afrikander influence in South Africa.
  For a time it supported the policy of Cecil Rhodes, but after 1895
  separated itself from him. After the war in 1902 the Bund was
  reorganized, and identified with the South African party whose policy is
  to further the federation of the South African colonies under the British
  crown.</p>

  <p><b>A&prime;ga,</b> formerly title of Turkish officers of a lower
  military rank, now of men of great wealth and influence except learned
  men and ecclesiastics, to whom the corresponding title of <i>effendi</i>,
  meaning 'elder brother' and subsequently 'master', is given.</p>

  <p><b>Ag&prime;ades,</b> a town of Africa, near the middle of the Sahara,
  capital of the Saharan oasis of Aïr or Asben; at one time a seat of great
  traffic, probably containing 60,000 inhabitants, now with a pop. of about
  7000.</p>

  <p><b>Agadir,</b> a little town on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, the
  Santa Cruz May of the Spaniards. It was seized by the Portuguese in the
  sixteenth century, and captured by Mulai Ahmed in 1536. It was once one
  of the most important seaports of Morocco, but is now closed to commerce
  and only used as a customs station, its place being taken by Mogador. In
  July, 1910, the appearance of a French cruiser in the port of Agadir gave
  rise to a Franco-German dispute, and in 1911 Germany sent the gunboat
  <i>Panther</i>, and a few days later the <i>Berlin</i>, to Agadir for the
  protection of German subjects. See <i>France</i>, <i>Germany</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Agallochum</b> (a-gal&prime;o-kum), a fragrant wood obtained from
  <i>Aloex&#x45E;lon Agall&#x14F;chum</i>, a leguminous tree of
  Cochin-China, and <i>Aquil&#x101;ria Agall&#x14F;cha</i>, a large tree
  found in north-east Bengal, abounding in resin and an essential oil which
  yields a perfume used as incense.</p>

  <p><b>Agal&prime;matolite</b> (Gr. <i>agalma</i>, image), a kind of

  <p><b>Agamem&prime;non,</b> in Greek mythology, son of Atreus, King of
  Mycenæ and Argos, brother of Menelaus, and commander of the allied Greeks
  at the siege of Troy. Returning home after the fall of Troy, he was
  treacherously assassinated by his wife, Clytemnestra, and her paramour,
  Ægisthus, Agamemnon's cousin. He was the father of Orestes,
  Iphigen&#x12B;a, and Electra.</p>

  <p><b>Agamogenesis</b> (-jen&prime;e-sis; Gr. <i>a</i>, priv.,
  <i>gamos</i>, marriage, <i>genesis</i>, reproduction), the production of
  young without the congress of the sexes, one of the phenomena of
  alternate generation. See <i>Generation</i> and
  <i>Parthenogenesis</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Aganippe</b> (-nip&prime;&#x113;), daughter of the river-god
  Parmessos, or Termessos, nymph of a fountain on Mount Helicon, in Greece,
  sacred to the Muses, which had the property of inspiring with poetic fire
  whoever drank of it. The name is often given to the wife of Acrisius and
  mother of Danae.</p>

  <p><b>Agape</b> (ag&prime;a-p&#x113;; Gr. <i>agap&#x113;</i>, love), in
  ecclesiastical history, the love-feast or feast of charity, in use among
  the primitive Christians, when a liberal contribution was made by the
  rich to feed the poor. For a time the agape coincided with the
  <i>eucharist</i>, which, at its origin, was clearly funerary in its
  intention. "For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do
  show the Lord's death till he come." During the first <!-- Page 57
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>[57]</span>three centuries
  love-feasts were held in the churches without scandal, but in after-times
  they acquired a bad reputation, not undeservedly, and they were condemned
  at the Council of Carthage in 397. Some modern sects, as the Wesleyans,
  Sandemanians, Moravians, &amp;c., have attempted to revive this
  feast.</p>

  <p><b>Agapemone</b> (ag-a-pem&prime;o-n&#x113;; lit. 'the abode of
  love'), the name of a singular conventual establishment which has existed
  at Spaxton, near Bridgewater, Somersetshire, since 1859, the originator
  of it being a certain Henry James Prince, at one time a clergyman of the
  Church of England, who called himself the Witness of the First
  Resurrection. The life spent by the inmates appears to be a sort of
  religious epicureanism. Some of the proceedings of the inmates of the
  'Abode of Love' have resulted in applications to the courts of law, where
  parties formerly members of the society have returned to the world and
  sought to regain their rights from Prince and his followers, and such
  cases have caused some scandal. In 1902 Prince was succeeded by T.&nbsp;H.
  Smyth-Pigott.</p>

  <p><b>A&prime;gar-a&prime;gar,</b> a dried seaweed of the Asiatic

    <i>Agaricus campestris</i>, the Common Mushroom
  </div>

  <p><b>Agar&prime;ic</b> (<i>Agar&#x12D;cus</i>), a large and important
  genus of fungi, characterized by having a fleshy cap or pileus, and a
  number of radiating plates or gills on which are produced the naked
  spores. The majority of the species are furnished with stems, but some
  are attached to the objects on which they grow by their pileus. Over a
  thousand species are known, and are arranged in five sections according
  to whether the colour of their spores is white, pink, brown, purple, or
  black. The chief British representatives are the common wild mushroom
  (<i>A. campestris</i>, L.), the Horse mushroom (<i>A. arvensis</i>,
  Schæff.), <i>A. elvensis</i>, B. and Br., <i>A. silvaticus</i>, Schæff.,
  &amp;c. Many of the species are edible, like the common mushroom, and
  supply a delicious article of food, while others are deleterious and even
  poisonous.</p>

  <p><b>Agaric Mineral,</b> or <b>Mountain-meal,</b> one of the purest of
  the native carbonates of lime, found chiefly in the clefts of rocks and
  at the bottom of some lakes in a loose or semi-indurated form resembling
  a fungus. The name is also applied to a stone of loose consistence found
  in Tuscany, of which bricks may be made so light as to float in water,
  and of which the ancients are supposed to have made their floating
  bricks. It is a hydrated silicate of magnesium, mixed with lime, alumina,
  and a small quantity of iron.</p>

  <p><b>Aga&prime;sias,</b> a Greek sculptor of Ephesus, about 400 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, whose celebrated statue, known as the Borghese
  Gladiator, representing a soldier contending with a horseman, is now in
  the Louvre, Paris.</p>

  <p><b>Agassiz</b> (ag&prime;as-&#x113;), Louis John Rudolph, an eminent
  naturalist, born 1807, died 1873, son of a Swiss Protestant clergyman at
  Motiers, near the eastern extremity of the Lake of Neufchâtel. He
  completed his education at Lausanne, and early developed a love of the
  natural sciences. He studied medicine at Zürich, Heidelberg, and Munich.
  His attention was first specially directed to ichthyology by being called
  on to describe the Brazilian fishes brought to Europe from Brazil by
  Martius and Spix. This work was published in 1829, and was followed in
  1830 by <i>Histoire Naturelle des Poissons d'eaux douces de l'Europe
  Centrale</i> (Fresh-water Fishes of Central Europe). Directing his
  attention to fossil ichthyology, five volumes of his <i>Recherches sur
  les Poissons Fossiles</i> appeared between 1834 and 1844. His researches
  led him to propose a new classification of fishes, which he divided into
  four classes, distinguished by the characters of the skin, as ganoids,
  placoids, cycloids, and ctenoids. His system has not been generally
  adopted, but the names of his classes have been taken as useful terms. In
  1836 he began the study of glaciers, and in 1840 he published his
  <i>Études sur les Glaciers</i>, in 1847 his <i>Système Glaciaire</i>.
  From 1838 he had been professor of natural history at Neufchâtel, when in
  1846 pressing solicitations and attractive offers induced him to settle
  in America, where he was connected as a teacher first with Harvard
  University, Cambridge, and afterwards with Cornell University as well as
  Harvard. After his arrival in America he engaged in various
  investigations and explorations, and published numerous works, including:
  <i>Principles of Zoology</i>, in connection with Dr. A. Gould (1848);
  <i>Contributions to the Natural History of the United States</i> (4
  vols., 1857-62); <i>Zoologie Générale</i> (1854); <i>Methods of Study in
  Natural History</i> (1863). In 1865-6 he made zoological excursions and
  investigations in Brazil, which were productive of most valuable results.

  <p><b>Ag&prime;ate,</b> a semi-translucent compound mineral mass formed
  in the cavities of rocks by the successive deposition of various types of
  silica, or by the staining of a siliceous mass thus deposited along
  concentric zones. Bands or layers of various colours blended together,
  the base generally being chalcedony, and this mixed with variable
  proportions of jasper, amethyst, quartz, opal, heliotrope, and carnelian.
  The varying manner in which these materials are arranged causes the agate
  when polished to assume some characteristic appearances, and thus certain
  varieties are distinguished, as the ribbon agate, the fortification
  agate, the zone agate, the star agate, the moss agate, the clouded agate,
  &amp;c. In Scotland they are cut and polished under the name of Scottish
  pebbles.</p>

    Agave (<i>Agave americana</i>)
  </div>

  <p><b>Agave</b> (a-g&#x101;&prime;v&#x113;), a genus of plants, nat. ord.
  Amaryllidaceæ (which includes the daffodil and narcissus), popularly
  known as American aloes. They are generally large, and have a massive
  tuft of fleshy leaves with a spiny apex. They live for many
  years&mdash;ten to seventy according to treatment&mdash;before flowering.
  When this takes place, the tall flowering stem springs from the centre of
  the tuft of leaves, and grows very rapidly until it reaches a height of
  15, 20, or even 40 feet, bearing towards the end a large number of
  flowers. The best-known species is <i>A. americ&#x101;na</i>, known as
  the Maguey or 'tree of wonders', introduced into Spain in 1561, and now
  extensively grown in the warmer parts of this continent as well as in
  Asia (India in particular). This and other species yield various
  important products, the chief being the fibre obtained by maceration from
  the leaves and roots, and known commercially as American aloe, pita flax,
  or vegetable silk. The sap when fermented yields a beverage resembling
  cider, the <i>pulque</i> beer of the Spaniards, or is distilled into an
  intoxicating spirit (Mezcal or Aguardiente). The leaves are used for
  feeding cattle; the fibres of the leaves are formed into thread, cord,
  and ropes, and are also good material for paper-making; an extract from
  the leaves is used as a substitute for soap; slices of the withered
  flower-stem are used as razor-strops.</p>

  <p><b>Agde</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>gd), a seaport of southern France,
  department of Hérault, with a cathedral, an ancient and remarkable
  structure. The trade, chiefly coasting, is extensive. Pop. 9265.</p>

  <p><b>Age,</b> a period of time representing the whole <!-- Page 59
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>[59]</span>or a part of the
  duration of any individual thing or being, but used more specifically in
  a variety of senses. In law <i>age</i> is applied to the periods of life
  when men and women are enabled to do that which before, for want of years
  and consequently of judgment, they could not legally do. A male at twelve
  years old may take the oath of allegiance; at fourteen is at years of
  discretion, and therefore may choose his guardian or be an executor,
  although he cannot act until of age; and at twenty-one is at his own
  disposal, and may alienate and devise his lands, goods, and chattels. In
  English law a male at fourteen and a female at twelve may consent or
  disagree to marriage, but it cannot be celebrated without the consent of
  the parents or guardians until the parties are of age. A female at
  fourteen is at years of legal discretion, and may choose a guardian; at
  seventeen may be an executrix; and at twenty-one may dispose of herself
  and her lands. So that full age in male or female is twenty-one years,
  which age is completed on the day preceding the anniversary of a person's
  birth, who till that time is an infant, and so styled in law. In France
  majority is attained at twenty-one, whilst the marriageable age is
  eighteen for males and fifteen for females, subject to consent of parents
  or guardians. In England no one can take a seat in Parliament under
  twenty-one, be ordained a priest under twenty-four, nor made a bishop
  under thirty. In France a seat in the Chamber of Deputies may be taken
  only at twenty-five and in the Senate at forty. The law of Scotland
  divides life into three periods&mdash;pupilarity, minority, and majority.
  The first extends up to the time of legal puberty, that is, twelve years
  for a female and fourteen for a male, when they may marry; the second
  extends from this point up to twenty-one years, which is the time when
  majority is attained.</p>

  <p>The term is also applied to designate the successive epochs or stages
  of civilization in history or mythology. Hesiod speaks of five distinct
  ages:&mdash;1. The <i>golden</i> or <i>Saturnian age</i>, a patriarchal
  and peaceful age. 2. The <i>silver age</i>, licentious and wicked. 3. The
  <i>brazen age</i>, violent, savage, and warlike. 4. The <i>heroic
  age</i>, which seemed an approximation to a better state of things. 5.
  The <i>iron age</i>, when justice and honour had left the earth. The term
  is also used in such expressions as the <i>dark ages</i>, the <i>middle
  ages</i>, the <i>Elizabethan age</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The <i>Archæological Ages</i> or <i>Periods</i> are three&mdash;the
  Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age, these names being given in
  accordance with the materials chiefly employed for weapons, implements,
  &amp;c., during the particular period. The Stone Age of Europe has been
  subdivided into two&mdash;the Palæolithic or earlier, and Neolithic or
  later. The word <i>age</i> in this sense has no reference to the lapse of
  time&mdash;or not necessarily so&mdash;but simply refers to the stage at
  which a people has arrived in its progress towards civilization; thus
  there are races still in their stone age. The Palæolithic or earlier
  stone age in Europe was doubtless immensely earlier than the Neolithic,
  the latter being marked by implements of much greater finish than the
  former. See <i>Stone Age</i>.</p>

  against the Persians, Thebans, and Athenians. Though a vigorous ruler,
  and almost adored by his soldiers, he was of small stature and lame from
  his birth. He died in Egypt in the winter of 361-360 <span

  <p><b>Agglom&prime;erate,</b> in geology, a collective name for masses
  consisting of angular fragments ejected <!-- Page 60 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>[60]</span>from volcanoes. When a
  rock mass consists largely of fragments worn and rounded by water it is
  called a <i>conglomerate</i>, and such masses were originally, no doubt,
  gravels and shingles on sea beaches and river channels.</p>

  <p><b>Agglu&prime;tinate Languages,</b> languages in which the modifying

  of many small florets having a common undivided receptacle, the anthers
  being distinct and separate, the florets commonly standing on stalks, and
  each having a partial calyx.</p>

  <p><b>Aggry Beads,</b> glass beads of various forms and colours, prized
  by the natives of West Africa as ornaments, and as having magical and
  medicinal virtues. Their origin and history are not well known. Such
  beads have been found in various parts of the world, including North and
  South America, and often in graves. Some authorities believe that the
  oldest of them are the work of the ancient Egyptians, or the
  Ph&oelig;nicians, while the later are probably of Venetian origin.</p>

  class="x3">&#x2D9;</span></span>-kör), a village of Northern France,
  department Pas de Calais, famous for the battle of 25th Oct., 1415,
  between the French and English. Henry V, King of England, eager to
  conquer France, landed at Harfleur, took the place by storm, and wished
  to march through Picardy to Calais, but was met by a French army under
  the Constable d'Albret. The English numbered about 15,000 men, while the
  French numbers are variously given as from 50,000 to 150,000. The
  confined nature and softness of the ground were to the disadvantage of
  the French, who were drawn up in three columns unnecessarily deep. The
  English archers attacked the first division in front and in flank, and
  soon threw them into disorder. The second division fled on the fall of
  the Duc d'Alençon, who was struck down by Henry himself; and the third
  division fled without striking a blow. Of the French 10,000 were killed,
  including the Constable d'Albret, with six dukes and princes. The English
  lost 1600 men killed, among them the Duke of York, Henry's uncle. After
  the battle the English continued their march to Calais.</p>

  reform of the abuses which had crept into the State&mdash;his plan
  comprehending a redistribution of the land, a division of wealth, and the
  cancelling of all debts. Opposed by his colleague Leonidas, advantage was
  taken of his absence, in an expedition against the Ætolians, to depose
  him. Agis at first took sanctuary in a temple, but he was treacherously
  seized and strangled, after going through the form of a trial.</p>

  <p><b>Agnostics</b> (ag-nos&prime;tiks; Gr. <i>a</i>, not,
  <i>gign&#x14D;skein</i>, to know), a modern term invented by Huxley in
  1869 and applied to those who disclaim any knowledge of God, the origin
  of the universe, immortality, &amp;c. The agnostics, or adherents of this
  doctrine, hold that the mind of man is limited to a knowledge of
  phenomena and of what is relative, and that, therefore, the infinite, the
  absolute, and the unconditioned, being beyond all experience, are
  consequently beyond its range. Agnosticism is therefore the attitude of
  'solemnly suspended judgment', and cannot be identified with atheism. The
  agnostics do not deny the existence of a Divine Being, but merely
  maintain that we have no scientific ground for either belief or
  denial.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Sir Leslie Stephen,

  <p><b>Agrarian Laws,</b> laws enacted in ancient Rome for the division of
  the public lands, that is, the lands belonging to the State (<i>ager
  publicus</i>). As the territory of Rome increased, the public land
  increased, the land of conquered peoples being always regarded as the
  property of the conqueror. The right to the use of this public land
  belonged originally only to the patricians or ruling class, but
  afterwards the claims of the plebeians on it were also admitted, though
  they were often unfairly treated in the sharing of it. Hence arose much
  discontent among the plebeians, and various remedial laws were passed
  with more or less success. Indeed an equitable adjustment of the land
  question between the aristocracy and the common people was never
  attained.</p>

  class="scac">A.D.</span> 37 to 93, a Roman consul under the Emperor
  Vespasian, and governor in Britain, the greater part of which he reduced
  to the dominion of Rome; distinguished as a statesman and general. His
  life, written by his son-in-law, the historian Tacitus, gives the best
  extant account of Britain in the early part of the period of the Roman
  rule. He was the twelfth Roman general who had been in Britain, but was
  the only one who effectually subdued the southern portion of it and
  reconciled the Britons to the Roman yoke. This he did by teaching them
  the arts of civilization and to settle in towns. He constructed the chain
  of forts between the Forth and the Clyde, defeated Galgacus at the battle
  of Mons Graupius, and sailed round the island, discovering the
  Orkneys.</p>

  <p><b>Agric&prime;ola,</b> Georg (originally Bauer, that is, peasant =
  Lat. <i>agricola</i>), born in Saxony 1490, died at Chemnitz 1555, German
  physician and mineralogist. Though tinged with the superstitions of his
  age, he made the first successful attempt to reduce mineralogy to a
  science, and introduced many improvements in the art of mining. A
  complete edition of his works was published at Basel in 1550 and
  1558.</p>

  <p><b>Agricola,</b> Johann, the son of a tailor at Eisleben, was born in
  1492, and called, from his native city, <i>master of Eisleben</i>
  (<i>magister Islebius</i>); one of the most active among the theologians
  who propagated the doctrines of Luther. In 1537, when professor in
  Wittenberg, he stirred up the Antinomian controversy with Luther and
  Melanchthon. He afterwards lived at Berlin, where he died in 1566, after
  a life of controversy. Besides his theological works he composed a work
  explaining the common German proverbs. <!-- Page 63 --><span

  <p><b>Agricola,</b> Johann Friedrich, German musician and composer, born
  near Altenburg 1720, died at Berlin 1774; pupil of Sebastian Bach; wrote
  several operas, including <i>Iphigenia in Tauris</i>. He wrote under the
  pseudonym of 'Olibrio'.</p>

  <p><b>Agricola,</b> Rodolphus, German scholar, born at Groningen 1443,
  died at Heidelberg 1485. After travelling in France and Italy he was
  appointed professor of philosophy at Heidelberg, and did good service in
  transplanting the revived classical learning into Germany.</p>

  <p><b>Ag&prime;riculture</b> is the art of cultivating the ground, more
  especially with the plough and in large areas or fields, in order to
  raise grain and other crops for man and beast; including the art of
  preparing the soil, sowing and planting seeds, removing the crops, and
  also the raising and feeding of cattle or other live stock. This art is
  the basis of all other arts, and in all countries coeval with the first
  dawn of civilization. At how remote a period it must have been
  successfully practised in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and China we have no means
  of knowing, but there is sufficient evidence of agriculture having
  attained considerable development many centuries before the Christian
  era. Egypt was renowned as a corn country in the time of the Jewish
  patriarchs, and had probably been so for centuries before. The
  hieroglyphics on ancient monuments furnish records of the early
  development of agriculture in Egypt and of the use of the plough and
  other agricultural implements. The advanced methods of the Egyptians and
  Syrians were introduced into Europe by the Saracens. Land culture also
  attained a more or less considerable development in ancient China and
  Hindustan. Among the ancient Greeks the implements of agriculture were
  very few and simple. Hesiod, who wrote a poem on agriculture as early as
  the eighth century <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, mentions a plough
  consisting of three parts, the share-beam, the draught-pole, and the
  plough-tail, but antiquarians are not agreed as to its exact form. The
  ground received three ploughings, one in autumn, another in spring, and a
  third immediately before sowing the seed. Manures were applied, and the
  advantage of mixing soils, as sand with clay or clay with sand, was
  understood. Seed was sown by hand, and covered with a rake. Grain was
  reaped with a sickle, bound in sheaves, thrashed, then winnowed by wind,
  laid in chests, bins, or granaries, and taken out as wanted by the
  family, to be ground. Agriculture was highly esteemed among the ancient
  Romans, and very full accounts are contained in the works of Pliny,
  Virgil, Cato, Varro, and Palladius. The Romans used a great many
  different implements of agriculture. The plough is represented by Cato as
  of two kinds, one for strong, the other for light soils. Varro mentions
  one with two mould-boards, with which, he says, "when they plough, after
  sowing the seed, they are said to ridge". Pliny mentions a plough with
  one mould-board, and others with a coulter, of which he says there were
  many kinds. Fallowing was a practice rarely deviated from by the Romans.
  In most cases a fallow and a year's crop succeeded each other. Manure was
  collected from various sources, and irrigation was practised on a large
  scale.</p>

  <p>The Romans introduced their agricultural knowledge among the Britons,
  and during the most flourishing period of the Roman occupation large
  quantities of corn were exported from Britain to the Continent. During
  the time that the Angles and Saxons were extending their conquests over
  the country agriculture must have been greatly neglected; but afterwards
  it was practised with some success among the Anglo-Saxon population,
  especially, as was generally the case during the Middle Ages, on lands
  belonging to the Church. Swine formed at this time a most important
  portion of the live stock, finding plenty of oak and beech mast to eat.
  The feudal system introduced by the Normans, though beneficial in some
  respects as tending to ensure the personal security of individuals,
  operated powerfully against progress in agricultural improvements. War
  and the chase, the two ancient and deadliest foes of husbandry, formed
  the most prominent occupations of the Norman princes and nobles. Thriving
  villages and smiling fields were converted into deer forests, vexatious
  imposts were laid on the farmers, and the serfs had no interest in the
  cultivation of the soil. But the monks of every monastery retained such
  of their lands as they could most conveniently take charge of, and these
  they cultivated with great care, under their own inspection, and
  frequently with their own hands. The various operations of husbandry,
  such as manuring, ploughing, sowing, harrowing;, reaping, thrashing,
  winnowing, &amp;c., are incidentally mentioned by the writers of those
  days; but it is impossible to collect from them a definite account of the
  manner in which those operations were performed.</p>

  <p>While there is much in the writings of the old English chroniclers
  concerning the tenure of land, upon which subject the <i>Domesday
  Book</i> gives much enlightenment, there is a great lack of information
  as to the manner in which the land was cultivated. Information began to
  be recorded in the middle of the thirteenth century, but only one
  treatise is known to have been written, namely, <i>La Dite de
  Husbanderye</i>, an essay in Norman French by Walter de Henley. This work
  was superseded by another treatise, the best of the early works on the
  subject, and published in the reign of Henry VIII (in 1523) <!-- Page 64
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>[64]</span>by Sir A.
  Fitzherbert, judge of the Common Pleas. It is entitled the <i>Book of
  Husbandry</i>, and contains directions for draining, clearing, and
  enclosing a farm, for enriching the soil, and rendering it fit for
  tillage. Lime, marl, and fallowing are strongly recommended. The subject
  of agriculture attained some prominence during the reign of Elizabeth.
  The principal writers of that period were Tusser, Googe, and Sir Hugh
  Platt. Tusser's <i>Five Hundreth Pointes of Good Husbandry</i> (first
  complete edition published in 1580) conveys much useful instruction in
  metre, but few works of this time contain much that is original or
  valuable. The first half of the seventeenth century produced no
  systematic work on agriculture, though several on different branches of
  the subject. About 1645 the field cultivation of red clover was
  introduced into England, the merit of this improvement being due to Sir
  Richard Weston, author of a <i>Discourse on the Husbandry of Brabant and
  Flanders</i>, to whom also belongs the credit of first growing turnips in
  England. The Dutch had devoted much attention to the improvement of
  winter roots, and also to the cultivation of clover and other artificial
  grasses, and the farmers and proprietors of England soon saw the
  advantages to be derived from their introduction. Potatoes had been
  introduced during the latter part of the sixteenth century, but were not
  for long in general cultivation. A number of writers on agriculture
  appeared in England during the Commonwealth, the most important works on
  the subject being Blythe's <i>Improver Improved</i> and Hartlib's
  <i>Legacy</i>. The former writer speaks of a rotation, or rather
  alternation of crops, and well knew the use of lime, as also of other
  manures. In the eighteenth century the first name of importance in
  British agriculture is that of Jethro Tull, a gentleman of Berkshire, who
  began to drill wheat and other crops about the year 1701, and whose
  <i>Horse-hoeing Husbandry</i> was published in 1731. Tull was a great
  advocate of the system of sowing crops in rows or drills with an interval
  between every two or three rows wide enough to allow of ploughing or
  hoeing to be carried on. This enabled the ground to be cleared with crops
  still growing, thus obviating the necessity for 'bare fallow' and leading
  to the <i>four-course</i> or Norfolk Rotation of Charles, second Viscount
  Townshend, the first agriculturist to cultivate turnips on a large scale.
  After the time of Tull and Townshend no great alteration in British
  agriculture took place till Robert Bakewell and others effected some
  important improvements in the breeds of cattle, sheep, and swine in the
  latter half of the eighteenth century. The raising and maintenance of
  live stock, especially of sheep, was a characteristic of English farming
  from a very early time, and for several centuries the country had almost
  a monopoly in the supply of wool. To Bakewell we owe the well-known breed
  of Leicester sheep. By the end of the century it was a common practice to
  alternate green crops with grain crops, instead of exhausting the land
  with a number of successive crops of corn. A well-known writer on
  agriculture at this period, and one who did a great deal of good in
  diffusing a knowledge of the subject, was Arthur Young. Scotland was for
  a long time behind England in agricultural progress. Great progress was
  made during the eighteenth century, however, especially in the latter
  half of it, turnips being introduced as a field-crop, and new implements
  such as the swing-plough and the thrashing-machine coming into general
  use. The construction of good roads through the country also gave
  agriculture a great impulse. During the wars caused by the French
  revolution (1795-1815) the high price of agricultural produce led to an
  extraordinary improvement in agriculture all over Britain. The
  establishment of the institution called the National Board of Agriculture
  was also of very great service to British husbandry at this period.
  Though a private association, it was assisted by an annual parliamentary
  grant, and prizes were given by it for the encouragement of experiments
  and improvements in agriculture. It existed from 1793 to 1816.</p>

  <p>Among other societies which have greatly furthered the progress of
  agriculture in Britain, the chief in existence at the present day are the
  Smithfield Club, inaugurated in 1798; the Royal Agricultural Society of
  England, established in 1838; the Highland and Agricultural Society of
  Scotland, founded in 1783; and the Royal Agricultural Society of Ireland,
  instituted in 1841. The objects of these and similar societies are such
  as the following: To encourage the introduction of improvements in
  agriculture; to encourage the improvement of agricultural implements and
  farm buildings; the application of chemistry to agriculture; the
  destruction of insects injurious to vegetation; to promote the discovery
  and adoption of new varieties of grain, or other useful vegetables; to
  collect information regarding the management of woods, plantations, and
  fences; to improve the education of those supported by the cultivation of
  the soil; to improve the veterinary art; to improve the breeds of live
  stock, &amp;c. Shows are held, at which prizes are distributed for live
  stock, implements, and farm produce.</p>

  <p>Through the efforts of the above-mentioned and other societies, the
  investigations of scientific men, the general diffusion of knowledge
  among all classes, and the necessity of competing with producers in
  foreign countries, agriculture made <!-- Page 65 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>[65]</span>vast strides in Britain
  during the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth. Among
  the chief improvements we may mention deep ploughing and thorough
  draining. By the introduction of new or improved implements the labour
  necessary to the carrying out of agricultural operations has been greatly
  diminished, and advancement in this direction has been promoted by the
  necessities of the Great War. Labour-saving machinery is likely to be
  used in future on an increasingly large scale. Science, too, has been
  called in to act as the handmaid of art, and in its application we owe
  very much to the researches conducted at the Rothamsted Experimental
  Station, founded in 1834 by Lawes, who endowed the Lawes Trust in 1889.
  Gilbert and he worked together from 1843 to the end of last century. It
  is primarily by the investigations of the chemist and physicist that
  agriculture has been put on a really scientific basis. The physiology of
  plants and animals, and the complex properties of soils, have all been
  investigated, and most important results obtained. Artificial manures, in
  great variety to supply the elements wanted for plant growth, have come
  into common use, and the free nitrogen of the air is now worked up into
  various substances by which the nitrate of soda imported from South
  America can be replaced. An improvement in all kinds of stock is becoming
  more and more general, feeding is conducted on more scientific
  principles, and improved varieties of crop-plants are created by applying
  the principles of Mendel and other scientists. Much attention is also
  devoted to seed-testing, and the applications of electricity to
  agriculture are being developed.</p>

  <p>As a result of the new conditions, to be a thoroughly-trained and
  competent agriculturist requires a special education, partly theoretical,
  partly practical. In many countries there are now agricultural schools or
  colleges supported by the State, and many such institutions exist in
  Britain. In Scotland, the Edinburgh chair of Rural Economy was founded in
  1790; in Ireland, the Glasnevin Institution was inaugurated in 1838; and
  the establishment of the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester, dates
  from 1845. In the United States nearly all the States have now colleges,
  or departments of colleges, devoted to the teaching of agriculture, and
  large allotments of public land have been made for their support. There
  are also numerous experimental stations. In Britain there has been a
  Board of Agriculture since 1889, under a cabinet minister, which was
  constituted a ministry in 1919; previously there was only a department
  under a committee of the Privy Council.</p>

  <p>It is probable that on the whole the agriculture of Britain is farther
  advanced than that of any other region of similar size. Wheat, barley,
  and oats are the chief cereals in Britain; the chief roots are turnips
  and potatoes; other crops (besides grass and clover) are beans, peas,
  mangold, hops, and flax. In Europe at large the principal cereals are
  wheat, oats, barley, and rye, wheat being mostly grown in the middle and
  southern regions, such as France, Spain, part of Germany, Austria,
  Hungary, Italy, and southern Russia, the others in the more northern
  portion, while maize is grown in the warmest parts. Turnips are
  comparatively little grown out of Britain, beet-root in some sense taking
  their place; potatoes, however, are largely cultivated, except in the
  south. In the United States maize is the chief corn crop, next to which
  comes wheat, then oats; potatoes are an important crop, but turnips are
  only grown to a very small extent. In Canada large quantities of wheat
  are grown (more especially in Manitoba and the North-West), much is also
  now produced in the Australian colonies, in India, Argentina,

  and set about subduing the provinces surrounding his realm. Among his
  first acts was the securing of the famed Koh-i-noor diamond, which had
  fallen into the hands of his predecessor. He crossed the Indus in 1748,
  and his conquests in Northern India culminated in the defeat of the
  Mahrattas at Panipat (6th Jan., 1761). Affairs in his own country
  necessitated his withdrawal from India, but he extended his empire vastly
  in other directions far beyond the limits of modern Afghanistan. He was
  succeeded by his son Timur.</p>

  aboriginal inhabitants of Japan. They do not average over 5 feet in
  height, but are strong and active. They are very hairy, wear matted
  beards, and have black hair which they allow to grow till it falls over
  their shoulders. Their complexion is dark brown, approaching to black.
  They support themselves by hunting and fishing. There are numerous
  legends relating to the Ainos. According to one of these, of Japanese
  origin, they descended from the constellation of the Bear, whilst another
  mentions as their ancestor a certain Okikurumi who came down from heaven.
  The Ainos call themselves Ainu Utara, and the Chinese refer to them as

  <p><b>Air,</b> the gaseous substance of which our atmosphere consists,
  being a mixture mainly of about 78 per cent by volume of nitrogen and 21
  per cent of oxygen. The latter is absolutely essential to animal life,
  while the purpose chiefly served by the nitrogen appears to be to dilute
  the oxygen. Oxygen is more soluble in water than nitrogen, and hence the
  air dissolved in water contains about 10 per cent more oxygen than
  atmospheric air. The oxygen therefore available for those animals which
  breathe by gills is somewhat less diluted with nitrogen, but it is very
  much diluted with water. For the various properties and phenomena
  connected with air see such articles as <i>Atmosphere</i>,

  <p><b>Air,</b> in music (in It. <i>aria</i>), a continuous melody, in
  which some lyric subject or passion is expressed. The lyric melody of a
  single voice, accompanied by instruments, is its proper form of
  composition. Thus we find it in the higher order of musical works; as in
  cantatas, oratorios, operas, and also independently in
  concertos.&mdash;<i>Air</i> is also the name often given to the upper or
  most prominent part in a concerted piece, and is thus equivalent to

  <p><b>Air Beds and Cushions,</b> often used by the sick and invalids, are
  composed of india-rubber or of cloth made air-tight by a solution of
  india-rubber, and when required for use filled with air, which thus
  supplies the place of the usual stuffing materials. They tend to prevent
  bed-sores from continuous lying in one position. They are also cheap and
  easily transported, as the bed or cushion, when not in use, can be packed
  in small compass, to be again inflated with air when wanted.</p>

  <p><b>Air-brake,</b> a brake operated by air pressure, usually applied to
  brake, simultaneously, all the wheels of a moving train. In the
  Westinghouse type, by means of an ingenious 'triple valve' carried one on
  each carriage, the train pipe is made to serve the dual purpose of supply
  and control. An air-pump on the engine compresses air into the main
  receiver, from which it flows through a reducing valve into the train
  pipe. The pressure, acting on the under side of the triple valve, moves
  the valve to its extreme <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page70"></a>[70]</span>position, thereby opening a passage to an
  auxiliary receiver on the carriage and also putting the brake cylinder
  into communication with the atmosphere. A spring in the brake cylinder
  keeps the brakes in the 'off' position.</p>

  <p>To apply the brakes, the pressure is lowered in the train pipe. The
  air pressure in the auxiliary receiver reverses the triple valve, thus
  admitting air to the brake cylinder and closing the outlet to
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>To remove the brakes, air from the main receiver is passed into the
  train pipe, and the triple valve is restored to the 'off' position. See

  <p><b>Air-cells,</b> cavities in the cellular tissue of the stems and
  leaves of plants which contain air only, the juices of the plants being
  contained in separate vessels. They are largest and most numerous in
  aquatic plants, as in the <i>Vallisneria spir&#x101;lis</i> and the
  <i>Victoria regia</i>, the gigantic leaves of which latter are buoyed up
  on the surface of the water by their means.&mdash;The minute cells in the
  lungs of animals are also called air-cells. There are also air-cells in
  the bodies of birds. They are connected with the respiratory system, and
  are situated in the cavity of the thorax and abdomen, and sometimes
  extend into the bones. They are most fully developed in birds of powerful
  and rapid flight, such as the albatross.</p>

  <p><b>Air-engine,</b> an engine in which air heated, and so expanded, or
  compressed air is used as the motive power. A great many engines of the
  former kind have been invented, some of which have been found to work
  pretty well where no great power is required. They may be said to be
  essentially similar in construction to the steam-engine, though of course
  the expansibility of air by heat is small compared with the expansion
  that takes place when water is converted into steam. Engines working by
  compressed air have been found very useful in mining, tunnelling,
  &amp;c., and the compressed air may be conveyed to its destination by
  means of pipes. In such cases the waste air serves for ventilation and
  for reducing the oppressive heat.</p>

  <p><b>Air-gun,</b> a gun from which the bullet is propelled by means of
  compressed air. Until about the middle of the nineteenth century air-guns
  were made with a metal reservoir in the butt; this reservoir was charged
  with air by means of a pump, and although one pumping put in enough air
  for six or seven shots, the process of loading was awkward and laborious.
  The well-known 'Gem' air-gun was worked by means of a spring, which
  compressed the air; the great defect of this gun was that the barrel was
  used as a cocking-lever, and so was apt to become bent and inaccurate.
  The 'Gem' was a smooth-bore gun, and early attempts at rifled air-guns
  failed, as the pellet was apt to stick in the barrel, owing to the low
  velocity not allowing it to take the grooves. The 'Quackenbush' air-gun
  made an attempt to get over this difficulty; its slugs were felted, and
  the felt took the rifling and greatly increased the accuracy of the
  weapon, but, of course, the ammunition was much more expensive than
  ordinary air-gun pellets. The B.S.A. air-rifle is an excellent weapon
  which has overcome all the early difficulties of construction. It has a
  fixed barrel, a separate cocking-lever, and a rotating breech-plug, and
  the muzzle velocity of its 16-grain pellet is 600 feet per second, which
  compares not unfavourably with the 1000 feet per second of the 40-grain
  bullet of a .22 long-rifle cartridge. An air-gun is a splendid weapon for
  practising markmanship, as it is almost noiseless, and as its ammunition
  costs little. It does not need to be elaborately cleaned, as a miniature
  rifle does; an occasional oiling is all that it requires to keep it in
  order, and with care it should fire an indefinite number of shots without
  losing its accuracy. <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><b>Air-plants,</b> or <b>Epiphytes,</b> are plants that grow upon
  other plants or trees, apparently without receiving any nutriment
  otherwise than from the air. The name is restricted to flowering plants
  (mosses or lichens being excluded) and is suitably applied to many
  species of orchids. The conditions necessary to the growth of such plants
  are excessive heat and moisture, and hence their chief localities are the
  damp and shady tropical forests of Africa, Asia, and America. They are
  particularly abundant in Java and tropical America.</p>

  <p><b>Air-pump,</b> an apparatus by means of which air or other gas may
  be removed from or compressed into an enclosed space. It was invented by
  Otto von Guericke of Magdeburg about the year 1654, and described in 1657
  by Gaspar Schott. An ordinary suction-pump for water is on the same
  principle as the air-pump; indeed, before water reaches the top of the
  pipe the air has been pumped out by the same machinery which pumps the
  water. An ordinary air-pump (see fig. 1) consists essentially of a
  cylinder or barrel with a piston and valves. The barrel is connected to
  the vessel from which the air is to be pumped. <span
  class="scac">A</span> is the vessel to be exhausted, <span
  class="scac">C</span> the air-pump cylinder, <span class="scac">P</span>
  the piston, <span class="scac">VV</span> valves in the piston, and <span
  class="scac">O</span> the connection to the vessel <span
  class="scac">A</span>. When the piston moves downwards from the position
  shown, it cuts off the connection with <span class="scac">A</span> by
  passing over <span class="scac">O</span>. The length <span
  class="scac">L</span> is made long enough so that <span
  class="scac">O</span> is kept covered up during the downstroke. The air
  filling the space <span class="scac">D</span> is compressed, and so lifts
  the valves <span class="scac">VV</span> and passes out through them. This
  goes on till the end of the downward stroke, when the volume is very
  small indeed. When the upward motion begins, the valves <span
  class="scac">VV</span> close, and the piston rises and creates a vacuum
  in <span class="scac">D</span>. When the piston rises sufficiently to
  uncover <span class="scac">O</span> (as in figure), air rushes from <span
  class="scac">A</span> into the highly-exhausted space <span
  class="scac">D</span> and fills it. The process is repeated indefinitely,
  and <span class="scac">A</span> is gradually exhausted.</p>

  </div>

  <p>Air-pumps for compressing air are constructed on the same principle,
  but the valves act the reverse way. The bicycle pump is a well-known
  example of this form of pump. In the Fleuss or Geryk pump greater
  efficiency is attained by having layers of oil in the barrel and above
  the piston. In nearly all pumps for producing the high vacua necessary,
  e.g. for the electric glow-lamp and the X-ray tube, mercury is employed.
  In one form, the Toepler pump, a reservoir containing mercury is
  connected by a flexible tube to the receiver. (See fig 2. <span
  class="scac">T</span> tube connecting pump to vessel to be exhausted;
  <span class="scac">R</span>, reservoir, raised above <span
  class="scac">A</span> to drive air in <span class="scac">B</span> and
  <span class="scac">C</span> through <span class="scac">D</span> and out
  into open air; <span class="scac">R</span> is then lowered, and <span
  class="scac">B</span> and <span class="scac">C</span> fill with air from
  receiver. Process then repeated.) By alternately lowering and raising the
  reservoir, gas is first withdrawn from the receiver and then expelled
  through <span class="scac">D</span>, which also acts as a barometer. The
  process is repeated until the desired degree of exhaustion is reached. In
  a second type, the Sprengel pump, a stream of mercury from a reservoir
  situated above the vessel to be exhausted falls in drops through a narrow
  vertical tube which communicates with the vessel. (See fig. 3. <span
  class="scac">A</span>, reservoir; <span class="scac">B</span>, tube
  leading to vessel to be exhausted; <span class="scac">C</span>, bubbles
  of air carried down by mercury.) The air is entrapped between the falling
  drops of mercury, <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page72"></a>[72]</span>and is carried down and expelled with it. In
  the filter-pump, water is used instead of mercury, the pump being
  connected to an ordinary water-tap.</p>

  <p>A more recent form, the Gaede pump, is of the rotary type. (See fig.
  4. <span class="scac">C</span>, iron case; <span class="scac">G</span>,
  glass front; <span class="scac">P</span> two-chamber porcelain drum
  rotated counter-clockwise about axle <span class="scac">A</span>. As
  mercury leaves chamber <span class="scac">R</span>, air enters from
  receiver by tube <span class="scac">T</span> and opening <span
  class="scac">B</span>. When <span class="scac">B</span> is immersed,
  mercury enters and air is driven into case <span class="scac">C</span>
  and removed through tube <span class="scac">S</span>.) A porcelain drum,
  divided into two cells, rotates within an air-tight case more than half
  filled with mercury. Each cell has an opening which, when above the
  mercury surface, places the cell in communication with the receiver. When
  the opening is immersed, the entrapped air passes by another channel into
  the outer case, from which it is removed by another less efficient pump.
  The pump will reduce the pressure within a 6-litre bulb from 10
  millimetres to .00001 millimetre of mercury in fifteen minutes.
  Langmuir's pump employs the principle of the aspirator. A current of
  mercury vapour passes from a mercury boiler past a tube communicating
  with the apparatus to be exhausted, and sucks the air from it; the
  mercury is condensed in the upper part of the pump, returns by side tubes
  to the boiler and leaves the extracted air in this condenser. A less
  efficient pump is employed to remove the air from the mercury condenser
  as it accumulates. This pump is said to be simple and rapid in action,
  and capable of exhausting an 11-litre bulb from atmospheric pressure to
  .00001 millimetre in eighty seconds.</p>

  <p>Air-pumps are largely used in steam engineering, both on land and at
  sea, to extract the air which enters the condenser with the steam (see
  <i>Condenser</i>). Several varieties of air-pumps are in use. 1. The
  ordinary piston-pump (fig. 1) in which the piston extracts air by first
  sucking it into the cylinder and then expelling it to the atmosphere. The
  opening leading to the condenser is closed during the stroke in which the
  air is expelled. Two or three cylinders are usually provided on each
  air-pump set, the former type being known as a 2-throw pump and the
  latter a 3-throw pump. One of the best-known makes is the <i>Edwards</i>
  air-pump. Piston air-pumps are driven either by the main engine through a
  suitable mechanism, or by a separate electric motor. The amount of power
  required to drive them varies with the size of the set, and with large
  engines of over 10,000 h.p. it is about ½ per cent or less. Vacua as high
  as 29 inches (Bar. 30 inches) can be readily maintained on large plants
  by this type of pump, provided the condenser is suitably designed. In
  well-maintained plants bad vacua are commonly due to deficient air
  extraction, which may arise from the low-pressure air-piping not being
  air-tight, or from the air-pump being too small. 2. The water-ejector
  type uses the momentum of a jet of water to extract the air entrained
  with it. Well-known types of this plant are the ordinary barometric
  jet-condenser and the <i>Leblanc</i> air-pump. In the latter type, a
  rotating wheel, which carries vanes, forcibly throws sheets of water into
  a pipe communicating with the condenser. The sheets of water lie across
  the pipe, and the space between them is filled up with air sucked from
  the condenser. This water, with the entrained air, is thrown out, against
  the atmospheric pressure, by the momentum imparted to the water sheets by
  the rotating wheel. Very high vacua can be obtained with the Leblanc
  pump, but the power required to drive it is more than is required with a
  3-throw piston-pump. (Cp. Sprengel pump above). 3. A steam-ejector is
  also used, a jet of steam taking the place of the sheets of water in the
  Leblanc type. Parsons' <i>augmentor condenser</i> works on this
  principle. A small jet of steam sucks the air from the main condenser and
  compresses it into a small so-called augmentor condenser. The pressure in
  this condenser is a little higher than the pressure in the main
  condenser, but it is sufficient to enable an ordinary 3-throw pump to be
  used efficiently. The steam used to extract the air is condensed in the
  augmentor condenser by cold water, and the interior of the augmentor
  condenser is connected to the inlet of an ordinary 3-throw pump. The
  3-throw pump is called upon to deal with the air at a slightly higher
  pressure than the condenser pressure, and the vacuum in the main
  condenser is improved by the drop of pressure which exists between the
  augmentor condenser and the main condenser. In a well-designed plant, for
  instance, a 3-throw pump might be used to maintain a vacuum of 29 inches
  in the augmentor condenser, while the steam jet would provide another ½
  inch of vacuum, giving 29½ inches vacuum in the main condenser. The
  <i>pressure</i> in the main condenser is thereby reduced from 1 inch Hg.
  to ½ inch Hg.; a reduction of <i>one-half</i>. (Cp. Langmuir's pump
  above&mdash;using a <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><b>Air-raids.</b> Apart from various sporadic bomb-dropping attacks by
  the Italians in Tripoli in 1913, the first air-raid proper was made by a
  Zeppelin on Antwerp during the investiture of that city by the Germans in
  1914. Later on this new method of warfare was developed to a considerable
  extent by both sides during the Great European War, both air-ships and
  aeroplanes being used. Air-craft for this purpose have been likened to
  long-range guns, with the advantage of greater precision, because the
  target is in view, and very much longer effective range&mdash;the
  Germans, for example, used to raid London, and on one occasion Edinburgh,
  from bases situated in North Germany and on the Schleswig coast.
  Air-raids are of great value in affecting the <i>moral</i> of the enemy
  country by bringing home the effects of war in its most terrifying aspect
  to the civilian population at home, and thus causing the dislocation of
  traffic and diminishing the output of munitions. Their practical value is
  in attacking and destroying munition-factories, army head-quarters, naval
  bases, &amp;c., in addition to such important work as the demolition of
  ammunition-dumps, and cutting lines of communication behind the
  front.</p>

  <p>Various protective devices against raiding aircraft have been
  invented. Among these are high-angle guns, capable of throwing shells to
  a height of some 30,000 feet, though possibly the most effective defence
  is small high-speed aeroplanes armed with machine-guns and capable of
  reaching great heights in a short space of time. For use at night,
  kite-balloons (see <i>Balloons</i>) are sent up in clumps connected
  together by cables. From the cables is suspended a network of steel
  wires, which is invisible to the hostile air-craft, and in which they may
  become entangled and so brought down. These have been raised to a height
  of as much as 12,000 feet. For raiding purposes two types of
  aeroplane&mdash;in addition to air-ships&mdash;have been developed. 'Day
  bombers' carry out raids in daylight at heights of 12,000 to 20,000 feet
  on points from 50 to 100 miles behind the lines. 'Night-bombers' are
  slower machines which raid well into the enemy's territory&mdash;up to
  200 or more miles&mdash;at heights varying from 8000 to 12,000 feet. It
  is usual for night-raids to be carried out by squadrons of machines
  flying in formation, each machine carrying about a ton of bombs (in
  1918). Air-ships can carry 5-10 tons of bombs to places up to 1000 miles
  distant from their bases.</p>

  <p>During the last months of the war, our Independent Air Force dropped
  500 tons of bombs on German objectives, and this raiding over a wide area
  of industrial Germany played no small part in causing that loss of spirit
  among the enemy which led eventually to their request for an armistice,
  and their virtual capitulation.</p>

<p class="cenhead">AIR-SHIPS</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:65%;">

  </div>
  <p><b>Air-ships,</b> lighter-than-air craft provided with means of
  propulsion and steering. The air-ship, unlike the aeroplane, is not
  dependent upon its engines for its power to remain in flight, but derives
  its sustentation from the hydrogen gas with which it is filled. Hydrogen,
  first weighed by Henry Cavendish in 1766, is the lightest gas known,
  being 14.47 times lighter than air. In the pure state it has a lifting
  force of 71.155 lb. per 1000 cu. feet, but for calculation purposes is
  usually assumed to contain 5 per cent of impurities, giving a 'lift' of
  approximately 68 lb. per 1000 cu. feet. Hydrogen is, when mixed with air,
  highly inflammable, and helium has therefore been suggested as a
  substitute. This has a lift, when pure, of about 65 lb. per 1000 cu.
  feet, but is only found in a few places in America and is therefore at
  present too expensive to be used in quantities. The lift of any given
  quantity of hydrogen depends upon the difference between its weight and
  that of an equal volume of air. As the amount, and therefore weight, of
  air contained in a given space varies with the barometric pressure and
  temperature, the lift of hydrogen given above varies also. These figures
  are based upon a temperature of 60° F. and a barometric pressure of 30
  inches. As an air-ship rises from the ground, the density, and therefore
  pressure, of the air decreases, which causes the hydrogen in the envelope
  to expand proportionately. Rise in temperature has the same effect. When
  an air-ship ascends, the gas therefore expands, and at a certain point
  would burst the envelope were valves not provided to allow some of the
  gas to escape. It is important to realize that as the expansion occurs at
  a rate corresponding to the decrease in density no alteration in lift
  occurs so long as gas is not lost through the valves. This would continue
  indefinitely if the gas-chamber were capable of stretching indefinitely,
  but with the cotton-fabric used in practice a height is reached when gas
  commences to escape from the automatic valves. From this moment the lift
  of the air-ship begins to decrease. At a certain point this decrease will
  have reached such a point that the air-ship is 'in equilibrium', i.e. she
  weighs precisely the same as the volume of air she displaces. This is
  known as the 'maximum height'. Up to 10,000 feet it is roughly true that
  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>30</sub> of the lift is lost per 1000 foot rise.</p>

  <p>The simplest form of air-ship is the <i>non-rigid</i>, which consists
  of a rubberized cotton-fabric gas-container (the 'envelope'), from which
  the 'car', <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page74"></a>[74]</span>containing engines, crew, &amp;c., is hung
  by flexible steel-wire ropes. To resist the bending moment introduced by
  the weight of the car, the envelope is inflated with hydrogen under
  pressure&mdash;usually about 25 mm. of water. So long as this pressure is
  greater than any local compression due to bending or loading in the
  fabric, the envelope will retain its shape. On coming down from a height,
  owing to the loss of gas, as already explained, the pressure will be
  reduced, and something must be done to restore it or the envelope will
  buckle. Fabric bags, known as 'ballonets', are therefore fitted inside
  the envelope, and as the air-ship descends air is forced into these bags,
  which supplies the lost pressure and maintains the shape of the envelope.
  The height to which a non-rigid air-ship can go, on returning from which
  the ballonets will be just full of air and the pressure the same as at
  starting, is known as the 'maximum ballonet height'. Ballonets are
  usually equivalent in volume to rather less than a quarter of the total
  volume of the air-ship&mdash;giving a maximum ballonet height of 6000 to
  7000 feet. Usually from two to three ballonets are provided, according to
  the size of the air-ship. During the Great European War British non-rigid
  air-ships were constructed varying in size from a capacity of 70,000 cu.
  feet to 360,000 cu. feet. The former had one 75-h.p. engine, and the
  latter two of 375 h.p. each. Owing to difficulties in maintaining the
  shape and distributing the weight of the car over a long envelope, it is
  generally considered that 500,000 cu. feet probably represents the
  maximum size in which the non-rigid form of construction can be used.
  Above this size the <i>semi-rigid</i> type is used. In this case the
  envelope remains as in the non-rigid, but a girder or 'keel' is
  introduced between the envelope and the car, the weight of which is
  therefore taken by the keel and thence distributed to the envelope
  instead of being taken direct from the envelope as in non-rigids. There
  has been little development of non-rigids in Great Britain. The most
  prominent types are the Italian 'Forlanini', 'Verduzzio', and military
  air-ships. The keel, in all these examples, is not a rigid girder in the
  vertical sense, as it consists of a number of sections connected together
  by links. It is designed to resist compression only so long as it is held
  straight by the pressure of the envelope, and is not capable of taking a
  bending moment. When a size of about 1,000,000-cu.-foot-hydrogen capacity
  is reached it becomes economical to use the <i>rigid</i> method of
  construction. This is totally distinct from the other two types, as the
  non-rigid envelope is replaced by a rigid hull of sufficient strength to
  retain its shape without the assistance of any internal gas-pressure. The
  hull consists of a number of longitudinal members&mdash;usually built-up
  girders of 'duralumin', an aluminium alloy&mdash;connected together at
  distances of 25-30 feet by a number of 'transverse frames', or rings,
  forming bulkheads. The transverse frames are also of duralumin girders,
  and are braced by 'radical wires' running from the joints of these
  girders to a ring in the centre. Between each pair of these transverse
  frames is a gas-bag containing hydrogen. The gas-bags are made of
  rubberized cotton on to which is stuck 'gold-beater's skin', made from
  the lining of the intestines of an ox. This is done to prevent hydrogen
  leakage. This is necessary, as the fabric of the gas-bags of a rigid
  air-ship is lighter and contains less rubber than the envelope of a
  non-rigid.</p>

  <p>A '<span class="grk">&Delta;</span>'-shaped keel runs along the
  interior of the ship, its weight being taken on the two bottom
  longitudinal girders. The chief function of the keel is to distribute the
  load of the various weights to the transverse frames of the air-ship. In
  it are slung the petrol-tanks, water-ballast tanks, bombs, &amp;c., and
  living accommodation for the crew is also provided there. Along the
  bottom runs a walking-way from which access is gained to the cars and
  various parts of the air-ship. The cars containing the engines,
  wireless-cabin, and pilot's cabin are suspended from the transverse
  frames. Some of the cars, instead of being slung below the centre-line,
  are slung in pairs some little way up the side of the air-ship.</p>

  <p>All air-ships are steered by means of rudders and, in the vertical
  sense, elevators, in precisely the same way as aeroplanes. Up to the end
  of 1919 speeds of 84 miles per hour had been reached and air-ships had
  climbed to 24,000 feet. The greatest distance covered in one flight was
  4500 miles, while the longest time in the air was effected by R34 on her
  voyage to America, which occupied 108 hours&mdash;4 days 8 hours. Rigid
  air-ships of 2,750,000-cu.-foot capacity had been built with a length of
  nearly 300 feet and a gross lift of 60 tons. See also <i>Aeronautics</i>,

  <p><b>Ak&prime;bar</b> (that is 'very great'), a Mogul emperor, the
  greatest Asiatic prince of modern times. He was born at Amerkote, in
  Sind, in 1542, succeeded his father, Humayun, a grandson of Sultan Baber,
  at the age of thirteen, and governed first under the guardianship of his
  minister, Beyram, but took the chief power into his own hands in 1560. He
  fought with distinguished valour against his foreign foes and rebellious
  subjects, conquering all his enemies, and extending the limits of the
  empire farther than they had ever been before, although on his accession
  they embraced only a small part of the former <!-- Page 77 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>[77]</span>Mogul Empire. Although a
  Mohammedan by birth, he abandoned Islam and founded a new religion which
  he called 'Divine Faith' (<i>Diu-i-Olahi</i>). His contemporaries
  bestowed upon him the title of 'Guardian of Mankind'. He was also a
  generous patron of literature, and commissioned the Jesuit missionary,
  Jerome Xavier, to translate the four gospels into Persian. His government
  was remarkable for its mildness and tolerance towards all sects; he was
  indefatigable in his attention to the internal administration of his
  empire, and instituted inquiries into the population, character, and
  productions of each province. The result of his statistical labours, as
  well as a history of his reign, were collected by his minister, Abul
  Fazl, in a work called <i>Akbar-Nameh</i> (Book of Akbar), the third part
  of which, entitled <i>Ayini-Akbari</i> (Institutes of Akbar), was
  published in an English translation at Calcutta (1783-6, 3 vols.), and
  reprinted in London. He died in 1605. His mausoleum at Secundra, near

  <p><b>A&prime;kenside,</b> Mark, a poet and physician, born in 1721, at
  Newcastle-upon-Tyne, died in London in 1770. He was the son of a butcher,
  and was sent to the University of Edinburgh to qualify for the ministry,
  but chose the study of medicine instead. After three years' residence at
  Edinburgh he went to Leyden, and in 1744 became Doctor of Physic. In the
  same year he published the <i>Pleasures of Imagination</i>, which he is
  said to have written in Edinburgh, and which was translated into French
  by Baron d'Holbach (1769). In 1746 he wrote his much-praised <i>Hymn to
  the Naiads</i>. Having settled in London, he became a fellow of the Royal
  Society, and was admitted into the College of Physicians. In 1759 he was
  appointed first assistant and afterwards head physician to St. Thomas's
  Hospital. In his later days he wrote little poetry, but published several
  medical essays and observations. The place of Akenside as a poet is not
  very high, though Dr. Johnson praised the blank verse of his poems, and
  his somewhat cumbrous <i>Pleasures of Imagination</i> was once considered
  one of the most pleasing didactic poems in our language.</p>

  bounded by Tennessee, Georgia, Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, and
  Mississippi; area, 51,998 sq. miles. The southern part, bordering on the
  Gulf of Mexico and Florida, is low and level, and wooded largely with
  pine, hence known as the 'pine-woods region'; the middle is hilly, with
  some tracts of level sand or prairies; the north is broken and
  mountainous. The State is intersected by the Rivers Alabama, Tombigbee,
  Mobile, Coosa, Tallapoosa, Tennessee, &amp;c., some of them navigable for
  several hundred miles. The soil is various, being in some places,
  particularly in the south, sandy and barren, but in most parts is
  fertile, especially in the river valleys and in the centre, where there
  is a very fertile tract known as the 'cotton belt'. The climate in
  general is warm, and in the lowlying lands skirting the rivers is rather
  unhealthy. In the more elevated parts it is healthy and agreeable, the
  winters being mild and the summers tempered by breezes from the Gulf of
  Mexico. The staple production is cotton, especially in the middle and
  south, where rice and sugar are also grown; in the north the cereals
  (above all maize) are the principal crops. Alabama possesses extensive
  beds of iron ore and coal, with marble, granite, and other minerals; and
  coal and iron mining, and the smelting and working of iron, are now
  important industries. The manufacture of cotton goods is extensively
  carried on. The foreign trade is concentrated in Mobile, whence cotton is
  the principal export. The State sends eight representatives to Congress.
  Its principal towns are Montgomery, the seat of government, and Mobile,
  the chief port. There is a State university at Tuscaloosa, a university
  connected with the Methodist Episcopal body, several State normal
  colleges, besides professional schools, &amp;c., in the principal towns.
  Alabama became a State in 1819. It was one of the slave States. Pop.

  <p><b>Alabama,</b> The, a ship built at Birkenhead to act as a privateer
  in the service of the Confederate States of North America during the
  civil war begun in 1861. She was a wooden screw steamer with two engines
  of 350 h.p. each, 1040 tons burden, and carried eight 32-pounders. Before
  she was launched her destination was made known to the British
  Government, but owing to some legal formalities the orders given for her
  detention did not reach Liverpool till the day after she had left that
  port (29th July, 1862). She received her armament and stores at the
  Azores, and entered on her destructive career, capturing and burning
  merchant vessels, till she was sunk in a fight with the Federal war
  steamer <i>Kearsarge</i>, off Cherbourg, 19th June, 1864. As early as the
  winter of 1862 the United States Government declared that they held
  themselves entitled at a suitable period to demand full compensation from
  Britain for the damages inflicted on American property by the
  <i>Alabama</i> and several other cruisers that had been built, supplied,
  or recruited in British ports or waters. After a long series of
  negotiations it was agreed to submit the final settlement of the question
  to a court of arbitration, consisting of representatives of Britain and
  the United States, and of three other members, appointed by the King of
  Italy, the President of Switzerland, and the Emperor of Brazil. This
  court met at Geneva, 17th Dec., 1871, and a claim for indirect damages to
  American commerce having been abandoned by the United States Government,
  the decree was given in Sept., 1872, that Britain was liable to the
  United States in damages to the amount of 15,500,000 dollars (about
  £3,229,200). After all awards were made to private claimants about
  8,000,000 dollars still remain unclaimed.</p>

  the manufacture of ointment and perfume boxes, vases, and the like. It
  has a fine granular texture, is usually of a pure white colour, and is so
  soft that it can be scratched with the nail. It is found in <!-- Page 79

  Europe; in great abundance and of peculiarly excellent quality in
  Tuscany. From the finer and more compact kinds, vases, clock-stands,
  statuettes, and other ornamental articles are made, and from inferior
  kinds the cement known as plaster of Paris. A variety of carbonate of
  lime, closely resembling alabaster in appearance, is used for similar
  purposes under the name of <i>Oriental alabaster</i>. It is usually
  stalagmitic or stalactitic in origin and is often of a yellowish colour.
  It may be distinguished from true alabaster by being too hard to be
  scratched with the nail.</p>

  rescued by the Genie of the Ring, and by means of the Genie of the Lamp
  acquired great wealth, built a magnificent palace, and married the
  Sultan's daughter. Afterwards the magician got possession of the lamp,
  and caused the palace to be transported into Africa. Aladdin was
  arrested, but was again saved by the Genie of the Ring. He poisoned the
  magician, recovered the lamp, and by its means restored his palace to its

  comedies, and in 1634 another containing twelve. One of them, called
  <i>La Verdad Sospechosa</i> (The Truth Suspected), published in 1630 in a
  collection bearing the name of Lope de Vega, furnished Corneille with the
  groundwork and greater part of the substance of his <i>Menteur</i>. Hence

  <p><b>Al&prime;aric I,</b> King of the Visigoths, was born about the
  middle of the fourth century, probably in 370, and is first mentioned in
  history in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 394, when Theodosius the Great
  gave him the command of his Gothic auxiliaries. The dissensions between
  Arcadius and Honorius, the sons of Theodosius, inspired Alaric with the
  intention of attacking the Roman Empire. In 396 he ravaged Greece, from
  which he was driven by the Roman general Stilicho, but made a masterly
  retreat to Illyria, of which Arcadius, frightened at his successes,
  appointed him governor. In 400 he invaded Italy, but was defeated by
  Stilicho at Pollentia (403), and induced to transfer his services from
  Arcadius to Honorius on condition of receiving 4000 lb. of gold. Honorius
  having failed to fulfil this condition, Alaric made a second invasion of
  Italy, during which he besieged Rome three times. The first time (408)
  the city was saved by paying a heavy ransom; the second (409) it
  capitulated, and Honorius was deposed, but shortly afterwards restored.
  His sanction of a treacherous attack on the forces of Alaric brought
  about the third siege, and the city was taken 24th Aug., 410, and sacked
  for six days, Alaric, however, doing everything in his power to restrain
  the violence of his followers. He quitted Rome with the intention of
  reducing Sicily and Africa, but died at Cosenza in 410. Legend has it
  that he was buried beneath the river-bed of the Busenzo, the course of
  which was temporarily turned aside for the purpose.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;aric II,</b> King of the Visigoths from <span

  dominions of the Visigoths were at their greatest extent, embracing
  three-fourths of the modern Spain and all Western Gaul to the south of
  the Loire. His unwarlike character induced Clovis, King of the Franks, to
  invade the kingdom of the Visigoths. In a battle near Poitiers (507)
  Alaric was slain and his army completely defeated. The <i>Breviarium
  Alaricianum</i>, a code of laws derived exclusively from Roman sources,
  was compiled by a body of Roman jurists at the command of this King
  Alaric.</p>

  <p><b>Alarm,</b> in military language, a signal, given by beat of drum,

  feet) and Wrangell (17,400 feet). The climate of the interior is very
  severe in winter, but in summer the heat is intense; on the Pacific coast
  it is mild but moist. Alaska produces excellent timber. Numbers of
  fur-bearing animals abound, such as the fur-seal, sea-otter, beaver, fox,
  mink, marten, &amp;c.; and the fur trade has long been valuable. The
  coasts and rivers swarm with fish, and salmon and cod are caught and
  exported. Gold is now mined in several localities, especially Cape Nome,
  where a town has sprung up. The aboriginal inhabitants consist of
  Esquimaux and Indians. Alaska, called Russian America until 1867, was
  sold to the United States for 7,200,000 dollars, the acquisition being
  ratified by Congress on 20th June, 1867. It has a legislative assembly
  consisting of eight senators and sixteen representatives, and the
  legislature meets biennially since 1913. The capital was formerly Sitka,

  <p><b>Alb</b> (from Lat. <i>albus</i>, white), a clerical vestment of the
  Catholic Church worn by priests while officiating in the more solemn
  functions of divine service. It is a long robe of white linen reaching to
  the feet, bound round the waist by a cincture, and fitting more closely
  to the body than the surplice. It is now little used except during Mass.
  After the Reformation the <i>alb</i> was not used in the Church of
  England, but since the ritualistic revival in the nineteenth century it
  has again been introduced into a number of churches.</p>

  <p><b>Alba,</b> the name of several towns in ancient Italy, the most
  celebrated of which was Alba Longa, a city of Latium, according to
  tradition built by Ascanius, the son of Æneas, 300 years before the
  foundation of Rome, at one time the most powerful city of Latium. It
  ultimately fell under the dominion of Rome, when the town was destroyed,
  it is said. In later times its site became covered with villas of wealthy
  Romans.</p>

  <p><b>Alban,</b> St., the earliest British martyr, flourished in the
  third century, and was, it is said, converted from Paganism by a
  confessor whom he had saved from his persecutors. He refused to sacrifice
  to the gods, and was executed outside the city of Verulamium (St. Albans)
  in 285 or 305.</p>

  <p><b>Albani</b> (a<span class="x1"><span

  Italian painter, born at Bologna in 1578, died in 1660. He studied with
  Guido Reni under the Flemish painter Calvaert and the Caracci. It is said
  that his second wife, Doralice Fioraventi, bore him twelve children of
  such beauty that they served him as models for his paintings. Among the
  best known of his compositions are <i>The Sleeping Venus</i>, <i>Diana in
  the Bath</i>, <i>Danaë Reclining</i>, <i>Galatea on the Sea</i>,
  <i>Europa on the Bull</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Alba&prime;ni,</b> Madame, maiden name Marie Louise Emma Cecile
  Lajeunesse, famous singer, was born near Montreal in 1852, was trained at
  home by her father, and studied also in Paris and Milan. She made her
  first public appearance in Europe at Messina, in Bellini's <i>La
  Sonnambula</i>, and in 1872 sang in the Royal Italian Opera in London.
  Since then she has attained the position of one of the world's foremost
  singers, both in opera and oratorio. In 1878 she was married to Mr.
  Ernest Gye, the operatic manager. She adopted the professional name of
  Albani from Albany, in the United States, where as a girl she sang in the
  Roman Catholic cathedral. In 1911 she published her memoirs under the
  title of <i>Forty Years of Song</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Alba&prime;nia,</b> an extensive region stretching along the coast
  of the Adriatic for about 290 miles, and having a breadth varying from
  about 90 to about 50 miles. The boundary on the east is formed by a range
  of mountains, and the country is composed of at least nine ridges of
  hills, of which six are in Lower or Southern Albania (ancient Epirus) and
  the remainder in Central and Upper or Northern Albania. There are no
  large rivers, and in summer many of the streams are completely dry. The
  Drin or Drino is the largest. The most beautiful lake is that of Ochrida,
  20 miles long, 8 broad at the widest part. The Lake of Scutari, in Upper
  Albania, is the largest. Among trees Albania has many species of oak, the
  poplar, hazel, plane, chestnut, cypress, and laurel. The vine flourishes,
  together with the orange, almond, fig, mulberry, and citron; <!-- Page 82
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>[82]</span>maize, wheat,
  and barley are cultivated. Its fauna comprises bears, wolves, and
  chamois; sheep, goats, horses, asses, and mules are plentiful. The chief
  exports are live stock, wool, hides, timber, oil, salt-fish, cheese, and
  tobacco. The chief ports are Prevesa, Valona, and Durazzo. The
  population, about 850,000, consists chiefly of Albanians or Arnauts, or,
  as they call themselves, Skupetars, i.e. inhabitants of the mountains (by
  the Turks they are called Arnauts, by the Greeks Arbanites, and by the
  Serbs Arbanasi). They are spread along the coasts of the Adriatic and
  Ionian Seas. History and legend afford little or no record of the arrival
  of the Albanian race in the Balkan Peninsula. It may, however, be safely
  asserted that the Albanians are the direct descendants of the earliest
  Aryan immigrants, who were represented in historical times by the kindred
  Illyrians, Macedonians, and Epirots. The majority live in Albania, the
  rest in Montenegro, Greece, Southern Italy, Sicily, Bessarabia, and Asia
  Minor. As regards religion they are either Christians or Mohammedans.
  They are divided into several tribes, among whom the Suliotes are partly
  of Greek origin. The Albanian language is a branch of the Indo-European
  languages, and related to the long-ago extinct language of the
  Messapians. The language consists of numerous dialects, which may be
  divided into those of the Tosks in the south and the Gheggas in the
  north. Though their country became a province of the Turkish dominions in
  1431, they maintained for centuries a certain degree of independence,
  which the Porte never found it possible to overcome. On 28th Nov., 1912,
  the complete independence of Albania was proclaimed at Valona, a
  provisional government was founded under Ismail Kemal Bey, and Albanian
  autonomy was agreed to at the Ambassadorial Conference in London on 20th
  Dec. On 21st Feb., 1914, the crown was offered to Prince William of Wied,
  who arrived at Durazzo on 7th March. The prince was supported and advised
  by an International Commission of Control, but he left the country at the
  outbreak of hostilities in 1914. Attempts made by Essad Pasha to
  establish a military government failed, and the country was overrun by
  the Austrians, who captured Durazzo on 28th Feb., 1916. On 3rd June,
  1917, the general in charge of the Italian forces proclaimed Albania an
  independent country, and a provisional government was set up at Durazzo.
  Albanian independence was recognized by the Powers and Albania admitted
  to the League of Nations in Dec., 1920.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Alba&prime;no,</b> a city and lake in Italy, the former about 15
  miles south-east of Rome, and on the west border of the lake, amid
  beautiful scenery. An ancient tomb in the Etruscan style was for a long
  time looked upon as the sepulchre of the Horatii and Curiatii. Here are
  also the ruins of the villas of Pompey and Domitian. Pop. 8000.&mdash;The
  lake, situated immediately beneath the Alban Hill, is of an oval form, 6
  miles in circumference, surrounded by steep banks of volcanic tufa 300 or

  <p><b>Al&prime;bany,</b> the original Celtic name probably at first
  applied to the whole of Britain, but afterwards restricted to the
  Highlands of Scotland. It gave the title of duke formerly to a prince of
  the blood-royal of Scotland. The first duke was Robert Stuart
  (1345-1420), son of Robert II by his mistress Elizabeth Mure, and brother
  of Robert III. He was virtual ruler of the kingdom during the latter
  years of his brother's reign, and acted as regent for his nephew James I
  (kept a prisoner in England) till his own death. Another nephew, David,
  Duke of Rothesay, is said to have been starved to death in Falkland
  Castle at his instigation. His son Murdoch, second duke, succeeded him as
  regent, and was put to death by James for maladministration. The third
  duke was Alexander, second son of James II and brother of James III. A
  large part of his life was passed in France. His son John was the fourth
  who bore the title. He was regent of Scotland during the minority of
  James V (1515-23).</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;bany,</b> a city of the United States, capital of the
  State of New York on the west bank of the Hudson, 132 miles north of New
  York city, from and to which steamboats run daily. The Erie Canal and the
  numerous railway lines centring here from all directions greatly
  contribute to the growth and prosperity of the city, which carries on an
  extensive trade. It is a great mart for timber, and has foundries,
  breweries, tanneries, &amp;c. Albany was settled by the Dutch between
  1610 and 1614, and the older houses are in the Dutch style, with the
  gable-ends to the streets. There is a university, an observatory, and a
  State library with 90,000 volumes. The principal public buildings are the
  capitol or State-house, which cost about £5,000,000, and the State-hall
  for the public offices, a State arsenal, and numerous churches. Pop.

  above title. To escape from the ill-treatment of her husband she retired,
  in 1780, to the house of her brother-in-law at Rome, <!-- Page 83

  the poet Alfieri, whose mistress she became. After the death of Alfieri
  in 1793 she opened her famous political and literary salon frequented by
  the Duchess of Devonshire, the Duchess of Hamilton, Cardinal Consalvi,
  Samuel Rogers, Thomas Moore, Lamartine, and Chateaubriand. She died at
  Florence in 1824, where she was buried at the Church of Sta Croce, by the

    Wandering Albatross (<i>Diom&#x113;dea ex&#x16D;lans</i>)
  </div>

  <p><b>Al&prime;batross,</b> a large marine swimming bird of several
  species, of which the wandering albatross (<i>Diomed&#x113;a
  ex&#x16D;lans</i>) is the best known. The bill is straight and strong,
  the upper mandible hooked at the point and the lower one truncated; there
  are three webbed toes on each foot. The upper part of the body is of a
  greyish brown, and the belly white. It is the largest sea-bird known,
  some measuring 17½ feet from tip to tip of their expanded wings. They
  abound at the Cape of Good Hope and in other parts of the southern seas,
  and in Behring's Straits, and have been known to accompany ships for
  whole days without ever resting on the waves. From this habit the bird is
  regarded with feelings of attachment and superstitious awe by sailors, it
  being reckoned unlucky to kill one. Coleridge has availed himself of this
  feeling in his <i>Ancient Mariner</i>. The albatross is met with at great
  distances from the land, settling down on the waves at night to sleep. It
  is exceedingly voracious, whenever food is abundant, gorging to such a
  degree as to be unable to fly or swim. It feeds on fish, carrion,
  fish-spawn, oceanic mollusca, and other small marine animals. Its cry is
  harsh and disagreeable. Its nest is a heap of earth; its eggs are larger
  than those of a goose.</p>

  in 1664 in North Italy, and educated for the Church. In his youth he
  laboured as a gardener, but thanks to the protection of the Duc de
  Vendôme, whose secretary he became, and afterwards of the Duc de Parma,
  he rose to high position. The latter sent him as his minister to Madrid,
  where he gained the affection of Philip V. He rose by cunning and
  intrigue to the position of Prime Minister, became a cardinal, was
  all-powerful in Spain after the year 1715, and endeavoured to restore it
  to its ancient splendour. In pursuance of this object he invaded Sardinia
  and Sicily, and indeed entertained the idea of stirring up a general war
  in Europe. The alliance of France and England, however, rendered his
  schemes abortive, and led to his dismissal and exile in 1720. He wandered
  about a long time under false names, but on the accession of Pope
  Innocent XIII he was restored to all the rights and honours of a
  cardinal. He died in 1752, and was buried at Piacenza.</p>

  <p><b>Albert,</b> Prince, Albert Francis Augustus Charles Emmanuel,
  Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and Prince Consort of England, second son of
  Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg, was born at the Rosenau, a castle near
  Coburg, on 26th Aug., 1819. In 1837 he entered the University of Bonn,
  where he devoted himself to the studies of political and natural science,
  history, philosophy, &amp;c., as well as to those of music and painting.
  On leaving the university he made a tour through the chief cities of
  Italy with <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page84"></a>[84]</span>Baron Stockmar. On 10th Feb., 1840, he
  married his cousin, Queen Victoria of England. Leopold I, King of the
  Belgians and uncle of Queen Victoria, was greatly instrumental in
  bringing about the marriage. An allowance of £30,000 a year was settled
  upon the prince, who was naturalized by Act of Parliament, received the
  title of Royal Highness by patent, was made a field-marshal, a Knight of
  the Garter, of the Bath, &amp;c. Other honours were subsequently bestowed
  upon him, the chief of which was the title of Prince Consort (1857). His
  foreign birth at first caused him to be regarded with some suspicion, but
  his unfailing tact and genuine ability were not long in gaining their due
  recognition. He always carefully abstained from party politics, but his
  knowledge of the politics of his adopted country, both domestic and
  foreign, was profound and accurate, and must often have been of service
  to the queen and her advisers. He always took a deep and active interest
  in the welfare of the people in general. His services to the cause of
  science and art were very important; he presided over the commission
  appointed in 1841 to consider the best means of rebuilding the Houses of
  Parliament, and the great exhibition of 1851 owed much of its success to
  his activity, knowledge, and judgment. The amendment of the Articles of
  War in 1844 which ultimately put an end to duelling was due to his
  suggestion. Cambridge University conferred upon him the degree of <span
  class="scac">LL.D.</span>, and in 1847 he was elected Chancellor. He
  presided and delivered the inaugural address at the meeting of the
  British Association at Aberdeen in 1859. He died of typhoid fever on 14th
  Dec., 1861, after a short illness. A collection of his speeches and
  addresses was published in 1862. A biography of the prince by Sir
  Theodore Martin was published in 5 volumes, London, 1875-80.</p>

  <p><b>Albert,</b> first Duke of Prussia, and last grand-master of the
  Teutonic Order, was born in 1490; died in 1568. In 1511 he was chosen by
  the Teutonic knights grand-master of their order. Being nephew of
  Sigismund, King of Poland, the knights hoped by his means to be freed
  from the feudal superiority of Poland, and placed under the protection of
  the empire. This superiority, however, Sigismund refused to surrender,
  and war broke out between uncle and nephew. He subsequently became
  reconciled to his uncle, and obtained his investiture as hereditary Duke
  of Prussia under the Polish Crown, the territorial rights of the Teutonic
  Order being thus set aside. The latter years of his reign were spent in
  organizing the government and promoting the prosperity of his duchy; he
  founded schools and churches, established a ducal library, and opened the
  University of Königsberg in 1543.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;bert I,</b> Duke of Austria, and afterwards Emperor of
  Germany, son of Rudolph of Hapsburg, was born in 1248. On the death of
  his father in 1292 he claimed the Empire, but his arrogant conduct drove
  the electors to choose Adolphus of Nassau emperor. Adolphus, after a
  reign of six years, having lost the regard of all the princes of the
  Empire, Albert was elected to succeed him. A battle ensued near Göllheim,
  in which Adolphus was slain by his adversary, who was elected and
  crowned. Pope Boniface VIII, however, refused to acknowledge him as
  emperor, and ordered the electoral princes to renounce their allegiance
  to him. On the other hand, Albert formed an alliance with Philip le Bel
  of France, and offered so determined and successful a resistance to the
  papal authority that Boniface was induced to withdraw his opposition, on
  condition that Albert would break with his French ally. During the
  subsequent years of his reign the Emperor was engaged in unsuccessful
  wars with Holland, Hungary, Bohemia, and other States. His measures still
  further to strengthen his authority over the Swiss Forest Cantons of
  Unterwalden, Schwyz, and Uri drove the inhabitants into open revolt in
  Jan. 1308. While on his way to crush the Swiss he was assassinated, at
  Windisch in May, 1308, by his nephew John, Duke of Suabia, called
  afterwards the Parricide, whose inheritance he had seized upon.</p>

  <p><b>Albert I,</b> King of the Belgians, born on 8th April, 1875, at
  Brussels. He is the son of Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders (died 17th
  Nov., 1905), and of Princess Marie of Hohenzollern (born 17th Nov.,
  1845). After the death of his cousin, the Duke of Brabant, and of his
  father in 1905, Prince Albert became heir apparent. In 1906 he became
  member of the Belgian Senate and in 1907 was appointed by his uncle,
  Leopold II, Lieutenant-General. On 2nd Oct., 1900, he married Princess
  Elizabeth, daughter of Duke Charles Theodor of Bavaria; there are three
  children. He ascended the Belgian throne in Nov., 1909, after the death
  of his uncle Leopold II.</p>

  infested with crocodiles and hippopotami. It receives the Victoria Nile
  from the Victoria Nyanza, and the White Nile issues from its northern
  extremity.</p>

  <p><b>Albert-Bapaume.</b> Along the great trunk road from Albert to
  Bapaume and on either side of it, fierce fighting took place during the
  Somme offensive of 1916, marked by the stages La Boiselle, Pozières and
  Le Sars. When, in Feb., 1917, the Germans began the great retreat, the
  fortified village of Pys on the left of the road was seized at a rush. On
  the 26th the village of Warlencourt fell, and two days later Thilley
  village 1½ miles from Bapaume, was taken. The British troops, avoiding
  direct assaults, gradually encircled the town, forcing the Germans to
  withdraw. It was entered on 17th March.</p>

  <p><b>Alberta,</b> a province of Canada, established on 1st Sept., 1905,
  and comprising the former territory of Alberta and the part of the former
  territory of Athabasca lying west of the meridian 110°, and having the
  new province of Saskatchewan on the east, British Columbia on the west,
  the United States on the south, and Mackenzie territory on the north;
  area, 255,285 sq. miles. A large part of the area on the west is occupied
  by the Rocky Mountains, which are shared in common with Alberta and
  British Columbia, and consist mostly of a series of more or less parallel
  ridges. One or two of the loftier summits are in the province, others on
  the boundary. There is much valuable timber in this district. The general
  slope of the surface is from west to east and north-east. The province is
  intersected by numerous rivers and streams that have their sources in the
  Rockies, some of them, such as the Peace River and the Athabasca, sending
  their waters to the Arctic Ocean, while the others, such as the North and
  South Saskatchewan and their tributaries, belong to the Hudson Bay basin.
  In the extreme south are one or two small tributaries of the Missouri.
  There are a number of lakes, the largest being the Lesser Slave Lake and
  Lake Athabasca (partly in this province). Notwithstanding the number of
  the streams, there are districts, especially in the south, where
  agriculture cannot be successfully carried on without irrigation. Farther
  to the north there are areas highly suitable for agriculture, and timber
  is also abundant. Cattle ranching is successfully carried on in the
  south, but tillage, with and even without irrigation, is also carried on,
  fine crops of wheat being grown. The most valuable mineral is coal, which
  is found at various places, but is chiefly mined in the south at
  Lethbridge, and farther north in the Banff district. Here there are hot
  springs and grand scenery, and a large tract of land has been set apart
  as a national park. Near Edmonton, the capital, coal is found on the bank
  of the North Saskatchewan, and is readily worked. Iron, petroleum, and
  other minerals are found. The climate is very warm in summer, and in
  winter less severe and prolonged than might be supposed. The warm
  <i>chinook</i> winds from the Pacific often blow in winter, and speedily
  melt the snow. The province is crossed in the south by the Canadian
  Pacific Railway, running by way of Calgary and Banff, and crossing the
  Rockies. From Calgary one branch runs north to Edmonton, another runs
  south to M&lsquo;Leod, where other lines make a connection with the
  States railroads and British Columbia. Edmonton, being also on the
  Canadian Northern and the Grand Trunk Pacific, is bound to become a great
  centre of trade and provincial development. It and Calgary are the chief
  towns. The population in 1911 was returned at 374,663, the latest
  estimate being nearly 500,000.</p>

  in 1193, or 1205, studied at Padua, became a monk of the Dominican order,
  teaching in the schools of Hildesheim, Ratisbon, and Cologne, where
  Thomas Aquinas became his pupil. In 1245 he went to Paris and publicly
  expounded the doctrines of Aristotle, notwithstanding the prohibition of
  the Church. He is called Doctor Universalis, for he was one of the most
  proficient scholars of his day, second only to Roger Bacon in his
  knowledge of nature. He became rector of the school of Cologne in 1249;
  in 1254 he was made provincial of his order in Germany; and in 1260 he
  received from Pope Alexander IV the appointment of Bishop of Ratisbon. In
  1263 he retired to his convent at Cologne, where he composed many works,
  especially commentaries on Aristotle. He died in 1280. Owing to his

  <p><b>Albigenses</b> (al-bi-jen&prime;s&#x113;z), a neo-Manichæan sect
  which spread widely in the south of France and elsewhere about the
  twelfth century, and which differed in doctrine and practice from the
  Roman Catholic Church, by which they were subjected to severe
  persecution. They are said to have been so named from Albi, on the banks
  of the Tarn, a tributary of the Garonne, where, <!-- Page 86 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>[86]</span>and about Toulouse,
  Narbonne, &amp;c., they were numerous. They were also known as Catharists
  (q.v.) and their doctrines were similar to those of several other
  religious sects such as the Gnostics, Manichæans, and Bogomils. Among the
  principal doctrines of the Albigenses was the belief in the existence of
  two principles, good and evil, the creators of the spiritual and material
  worlds. Since all matter is under the control of the evil principle,
  maintained the Albigenses, all flesh is evil. The extinction of bodily
  life, therefore, the deliverance of the soul from the prison-house of the
  body, should be the aim of man. Suicide by means of starvation was
  consequently highly meritorious. It is admitted even by Catholic writers
  (see <i>Catholic Encyclopædia</i>, vol. i, p. 268) that the Albigenses
  were principally antisacerdotal and opposed to the Roman Church on
  account of the scandalous life led by the Catholic clergy. A crusade was
  begun against them, and Count Raymond VI of Toulouse for tolerating them,
  in 1209, the army of the cross being called together by Pope Innocent
  III. The war was carried on with a cruelty which reflected deep disgrace
  upon the Catholic Church. Béziers, the capital of Raymond's nephew Roger,
  was taken by storm, and 20,000 of the inhabitants, without distinction of
  creed, were put to the sword. Simon de Montfort, the military leader of
  the crusade, was equally severe towards other places in the territory of
  Raymond and his allies. After the death of Raymond VI, in 1222, his son,
  Raymond VII, was obliged, notwithstanding his readiness to do penance, to
  defend his inheritance against the papal legates and Louis VIII of
  France. When hundreds of thousands had fallen on both sides, a peace was
  made in 1229, by which Raymond was obliged to cede Narbonne with other
  territories to Louis IX, and make his son-in-law, a brother of Louis, his
  heir. The heretics were now delivered up to the proselytizing zeal of the
  Dominicans, and to the courts of the Inquisition, by which means it was
  brought about that the Albigenses disappeared after the middle of the
  thirteenth century. Cf. C. Schmidt, <i>Histoire et doctrine de la Secte
  des Cathares ou Albigeois</i> (2 vols.)</p>

  <p><b>Albinos</b> (al-b&#x12B;&prime;n&#x14D;z), the name given to those
  persons from whose skin, hair, and eyes, in consequence of some defect in
  their organization, the dark colouring matter is absent. The skin of
  albinos, therefore, whether they belong to the white, Indian, or negro
  races, is of a uniform pale milky colour, their hair is white, while the
  iris of their eyes is pale rose colour, and the pupil intensely red, the
  absence of the dark pigment allowing the multitude of blood-vessels in
  these parts of the eye to be seen. For the same reason their eyes are not
  well suited to endure the bright light of day, and they see best in shade
  or by moonlight. The peculiarity of <i>albinism</i> or <i>leucopathy</i>
  is hereditary and not confined to the human race, having been observed
  also in horses, rabbits, rats, mice, &amp;c., birds (white crows or
  blackbirds are not particularly uncommon), and fishes. Albinos are not of
  necessity lacking in mental vigour or capacity. Cf. Karl Pearson, <i>A
  Monograph on Albinism in Man</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;boin,</b> King of the Lombards, succeeded his father
  Audoin in 561, and reigned in Noricum and Pannonia. Narses, the general
  of Justinian, sought his alliance, and received his aid, in the war
  against Totila, King of the Ostrogoths. Alboin afterwards (in 568)
  undertook the conquest of Italy, where Narses, who had subjected this
  country to Justinian, offended by an ungrateful Court, sought an avenger
  in Alboin, and offered him his co-operation. After a victorious career in
  Italy he was slain at Verona, in 573 or 574, by an assassin, instigated
  by his wife Rosamond, whose hatred he had incurred by sending her, in one
  of his fits of intoxication, a cup wrought from the skull of her father,
  and forcing her to drink from it.</p>

  <p><b>Albu&prime;men,</b> or <b>Albumin</b> (Lat., from <i>albus</i>,
  white), a substance, or rather group of substances, so named from the
  Latin for the white of an egg, which is one of its most abundant known
  forms. It may be taken as the type of the protein compounds or the
  nitrogenous class of food-stuffs. One variety enters largely into the
  composition of the animal fluids and solids, is coagulable by heat at and
  above 160°, and is composed of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen,
  with a little sulphur. It abounds in the serum of the blood, the vitreous
  and crystalline humours of the eye, the fluid of dropsy, the substance
  called coagulable lymph, in nutritive matters, the juice of flesh,
  &amp;c. The blood contains about 7 per cent of albumen. Another variety,
  called vegetable albumen, exists in most vegetable juices and many seeds,
  and has nearly the same composition and properties as egg albumen. When
  albumen coagulates in any fluid it readily encloses any substances that
  may be suspended in the fluid. Hence it is used to clarify syrupy
  liquors. In cookery, white of eggs is employed for clarifying, but in
  large operations, like sugar-refining, the serum of blood is used. From
  its being coagulable by various salts, and especially by corrosive
  sublimate, with which it forms an insoluble compound, white of egg is a
  convenient antidote in cases of poisoning by that substance. With lime it
  forms a cement to mend broken ware.</p>

  <p>In botany the name albumen is given to the farinaceous matter which
  surrounds the embryo, the term in this case having no reference to
  chemical composition. It constitutes the meat of the coco-nut, the flour
  or meal of cereals, the roasted part of coffee, &amp;c.</p>

  Portugal having subjected to its power a large part of the western coast
  of Africa, and begun to extend its sway in the East Indies, Albuquerque
  was appointed viceroy of the Portuguese acquisitions in this quarter, and
  arrived in 1503 with a fleet on the coast of Malabar. His career here was
  extremely successful, he having extended the Portuguese power over
  Malabar, Ceylon, the Sunda Islands, and the Peninsula of Malacca, and
  made the Portuguese name respected by all the nations and princes of
  India. Notwithstanding his services and his virtues, he was unjustly
  superseded in his commands by his personal enemy Lopez Soarez, and so
  severely did he feel the ingratitude of his sovereign, King Emanuel, that
  he died a few days after receiving the intelligence. His famous letter to
  the king was discovered and published in 1542 by J.&nbsp;M. de Fonseca. The
  first volume of his letters was published in 1884 by the Royal Academy of
  Lisbon.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;chemy,</b> or <b>Alchymy,</b> the art which in former
  times occupied the place of and paved the way for the modern science of
  chemistry (as astrology did for astronomy), but whose aims were not
  scientific, being confined solely to the discovery of the means of
  indefinitely prolonging human life, and of transmuting the baser metals
  into gold and silver. Among the alchemists it was generally thought
  necessary to find a substance which, containing the original principle of
  all matter, should possess the power of dissolving all substances into
  their elements. This general solvent, or <i>menstruum universale</i>,
  which at the same time was to possess the power of removing all the seeds
  of disease out of the human body and renewing life, was called the
  <i>philosophers' stone</i>, <i>lapis philosophorum</i>, and its pretended
  possessors were known as <i>adepts</i>. Alchemy flourished chiefly in the
  Middle Ages, though how old such notions might be as those by which the
  alchemists were inspired it is difficult to say. There are many stories
  about the mystic origin of alchemy. The art is said to have been taught
  by the fallen angels, by Isis, or by Miriam, sister of Moses, or by John
  the Baptist. According to Suidas, Egypt was the home of alchemy, and the
  mythical Hermes Trismegistus of pre-Christian times was said to have left
  behind him many books of magical and alchemical learning, and after him
  alchemy received the name of the <i>hermetic art</i>. At a later period
  chemistry and alchemy were cultivated among the Arabians, and by them the
  pursuit was introduced into Europe. Many of the monks devoted themselves
  to alchemy, although they were afterwards prohibited from studying it by
  the popes. Thus Albertus Magnus is said to have been the author <!-- Page
  89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>[89]</span>of a work
  <i>De Alchimia</i>, and several treatises on the subject are attributed
  to Thomas Aquinas. But even Pope John XXII is said to have worked at the
  science at Avignon. Raymond Lully, or Lullius, a famous alchemist of the
  thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, is said to have changed for King
  Edward I a mass of 50,000 lb. of quicksilver into gold, of which the
  first rose-nobles were coined. Among other alchemists may be mentioned
  John Cremer, Abbot of Westminster (1327-77), Nicholas Flamel (1330-80),
  Basilius Valentinus, Isaac of Holland, and Paracelsus (1493-1541). With
  the growth of chemistry, the recognition of the chemical elements as
  forming a large number of distinct substances, and the conception of the
  fixed unalterable nature of the atoms, attempts to transform the base
  metals into gold were largely abandoned as being unscientific. But the
  most modern view of matter, namely, that the atoms of all elements are
  composed of numerous electrons, favours the idea of the transmutability
  of elements, and the production of helium from radium (see these
  articles) by Ramsay shows the possibility of this
  transmutation.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Pattison-Muir,

  <p><b>Alcibi&prime;ades</b> (-d&#x113;z), a famous Athenian statesman and
  general of high family and of great abilities, but of no principle, was
  born at Athens in the 82nd Olympiad, 450 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>,
  being the son of Cleinias, and a relative of Pericles, who also was his
  guardian. In youth he was remarkable for the beauty of his person, no
  less than for the dissoluteness of his manners. He came under the
  influence of Socrates, but little permanent effect was produced on his
  character by the precepts of the sage. He acquired great popularity by
  his liberality in providing for the amusements of the people, and after
  the death of Cleon attained a political ascendancy which left him no
  rival but Nicias. Thus he played an important part in the long-continued
  Peloponnesian war. In 415 he advocated the expedition against Sicily, and
  was chosen one of the leaders, but before the expedition sailed he was
  charged with profaning and divulging the Eleusinian mysteries, and
  mutilating the busts of Hermes, which were set up in public all through
  Athens. Rather than stand his trial he went over to Sparta, divulged the
  plans of the Athenians, and assisted the Spartans to defeat them.
  Sentence of death and confiscation was pronounced against him at Athens,
  and he was cursed by the ministers of religion. He soon left Sparta and
  took refuge with the Persian satrap Tissaphernes, ingratiating himself by
  his affectation of Persian manners, as he had previously done at Sparta
  by a similar affectation of Spartan simplicity. He now began to intrigue
  for his return to Athens, offering to bring Tissaphernes over to the
  Athenian alliance, and after a while he was recalled and his banishment
  cancelled. He, however, remained abroad for some years in command of the
  Athenian forces, gained several victories, and took Chalcedon and
  Byzantium. In 407 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> he returned to Athens,
  but in 406, the fleet which he commanded having suffered a severe defeat,
  he was deprived of his command. He once more went over to the Persians,
  taking refuge with the satrap Pharnabazus of Phrygia, and here he was
  assassinated in 404 <span class="scac">B.C.</span> The authorities for
  his life are Thucydides, Xenophon, Plutarch, and Cornelius Nepos.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;cohol,</b> or <b>Ethyl Alcohol,</b>
  C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O, is a substance obtained by allowing the
  juice of the grape to undergo a change known as fermentation. It is only
  in modern times that alcohol has been isolated and its properties
  examined. Alcohol is now prepared in enormous quantities, both for
  industrial purposes and for the preparation of alcoholic beverages, from
  substances rich in sugar or in starch. Potatoes and maize form the main
  source of alcohol. These are treated with steam under pressure in
  specially-constructed tanks to extract starchy materials. The starch so
  liberated is then fermented by means of a substance diastase. This
  treatment transforms sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid gas. The
  solution is then filtered to remove all insoluble matter, proteids,
  &amp;c., and from this solid residue, cattle-feeding cakes are made. This
  treatment yields a solution containing 9-10 per cent alcohol. The
  solution is fractionally distilled, using a special form of distilling
  column. The most volatile part of the distillate, first runnings,
  contains acetaldehyde, the second fraction contains the bulk of the
  alcohol and <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page90"></a>[90]</span>some water, and the least volatile portion,
  last runnings, fusel oil and higher alcohols. By this means a liquid
  containing 80-95 per cent alcohol, rectified spirits, is obtained. For
  preparation of beverages, fusel oil must be carefully separated from
  alcohol, as fusel oil has an injurious effect physiologically. The
  removal of the last traces of water from alcohol is very troublesome. It
  is repeatedly distilled over quicklime or freshly-ignited potassium
  carbonate, giving an alcohol containing 98-99 per cent alcohol. The small
  quantity of water still contained is removed by leaving it in contact
  with metallic calcium. An alcohol containing more than 96 per cent
  alcohol is known as <i>absolute</i>. Pure alcohol is a colourless
  poisonous liquid boiling at 78° C., possessing a strong odour and a
  burning taste. It is inflammable and mixes with water in all proportions
  and has a specific gravity 0.80625 at 0° C. Very low temperatures convert
  it into a glassy solid, melting at -117° C., hence it may be used in
  thermometers for low-temperature measurements. Alcohol burns with a
  non-luminous flame and gives out great heat; it is used, therefore, in
  various types of lamps for heating purposes. It is also used as a fuel
  for motors and is a very valuable solvent for many substances such as
  resin, oils, colouring-matter, varnishes, and ethereal essences. The
  so-called 'solid alcohol' can be obtained by dissolving 30 to 40 parts of
  collodion in 100 parts of alcohol, a solid which separates and burns like
  alcohol, leaving no residue. Alcohol is the important constituent of all
  alcoholic beverages and it is due to its presence that wine, whisky,
  &amp;c., have a stimulating and intoxicating effect on the nervous
  system. Beverages such as beer, wine, cider, &amp;c., are prepared by
  direct fermentation of sugars obtained in fruit juices in the case of
  wine and cider and from barley in the case of beer. These contain varying
  amounts of alcohol, thus wine may contain from 8 to 10 per cent of
  alcohol, whilst beer contains 3 to 5 per cent. Whisky, brandy, &amp;c.,
  contain more alcohol, 50-70 per cent, and for the preparation of these
  the alcohol used must be distilled and purified after fermentation. The
  alcohol content of an aqueous solution may be deduced from a
  determination of the specific gravity of the solution or directly by the
  Alcoholometer. This gives percentage by volume. The amount of alcohol
  present in any alcoholic beverage cannot be obtained directly, but if
  &#x2153; of the liquid be distilled and the distillate made up to the
  original volume, then the alcohol may be determined by the Alcoholometer.
  The name alcohol is applied generally in chemistry to a large group of
  substances, containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, which have chemical
  properties analogous to those of ethyl alcohol.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;coholism,</b> a morbid condition of the body (especially
  of the nervous system) brought on by the immoderate use of alcoholic
  liquors.</p>

  <p><b>Alcoholom&prime;eter,</b> an instrument constructed on the
  principle of the hydrometer, to determine from the specific gravity of

  marking directly the required proportion. If the liquor contain anything
  besides water and alcohol, previous distillation is necessary.</p>

  Rome, Charlemagne became acquainted with <!-- Page 91 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>[91]</span>him at Parma, invited him
  in 782 to his Court, and made use of his services in his endeavours to
  civilize his subjects. To secure the benefit of his instructions,
  Charlemagne established at his Court a school, called <i>Schola
  Palatina</i>, or the Palace School. In the royal academy Alcuin was
  called <i>Flaccus Albinus</i>. Most of the schools in France were either
  founded or improved by him; thus he founded the school in the abbey of
  St. Martin of Tours, in 796, after the plan of the school in York. Alcuin
  left the Court in 801, and retired to the abbey of St. Martin of Tours,
  but kept up a constant correspondence with Charles to his death in 804.
  He left works on theology, philosophy, rhetoric, also poems and letters,
  all of which have been published. His letters, 232 of which were
  addressed to Charlemagne, form the most important part of his work. As a
  philosopher, Alcuin, though lacking in originality, exercised a
  considerable influence over his contemporaries. The expression of
  'scholasticism' is attributed to him.&mdash;<span

  plants of the sub-ord. Betulaceæ (Birch), (nat. ord. Amentaceæ). Fourteen
  species are known as small trees or shrubs indigenous to temperate and
  colder regions of the globe; eight of these are found in Central and
  Western Europe. The only species indigenous to Britain is the common
  alder (<i>Alnus glutin&#x14D;sa</i>), a tree growing in wet situations in
  Europe, Asia, and the United States. Its wood, light and soft and of a
  reddish colour, is used for a variety of purposes, and is well adapted
  for work which is to be kept constantly in water. Alder is still largely
  used in gunpowder manufacture, and the roots and knots furnish a
  beautifully-veined wood well suited for cabinet work; it is used for
  cigar-boxes in East Prussia and West Russia. The bark is used in tanning
  and leather-dressing, and by fishermen for staining their nets. This and
  the young twigs are sometimes employed in dyeing, and yield different
  shades of yellow and red. With the addition of copperas it yields a black
  dye.</p>

  <i>ealdorman</i>, from <i>ealdor</i>, older, and <i>man</i>), among the
  Anglo-Saxons a person of a rank equivalent to that of an earl or count,
  the governor of a shire or county, and member of the <i>witena-gemót</i>
  or great council of the nation. Aldermen played an important rôle already
  before the Constitution of Egbert, but reached their highest power during
  the reign of Alfred the Great, who had married the daughter of an
  alderman. Aldermen, at present, are officers associated with the mayor of
  a city for the administration of the municipal government in England and
  the United States.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;derney</b> (Fr. <i>Aurigny</i>), an island belonging to
  Britain, off the coast of Normandy, 10 miles due west of Cape La Hogue,
  and 60 from the nearest point of England, the most northerly of the
  Channel Islands, between 3 and 4 miles long, and about 1¼ broad. The
  coast is bold and rocky; the interior is fertile. About a third of the
  island is occupied by grass lands; and the Alderney cows, a small-sized
  but handsome breed, are famous for the richness of their milk. The
  climate is mild and healthy. A judge, with six 'jurats', chosen by the
  people for life, and twelve 'douzainiers', representatives of the people,
  form a kind of local legislature. The French language still prevails
  among the inhabitants, but all understand and many speak English. The
  <i>Race of Alderney</i> is the strait between the coast of France and
  this island. Pop. 2561.</p>

  <p><b>Aldershot</b> (äl&prime;d&#x117;r-), a town and military station in
  England, the latter having given rise to the former. The 'camp' was
  originated in 1854 by the purchase by Government of a tract of moorland
  known as Aldershot Heath, on the confines of Surrey, Hampshire, and
  Berkshire. The object was to accustom both officers and soldiers to act
  more readily when drawn up in brigades and divisions, their practice
  having been limited for the most part, since the termination of the
  French war, to the movements of battalions and companies. It was also
  deemed advisable to accustom the army to camp life, and to exercise the
  men in all the evolutions and movements which they might be required to
  perform when brought into actual contact with the enemy. The
  accommodation provided for the army, officers as well as men, consisted
  at first of wooden huts; but these have been superseded by brick
  barracks, and altogether the money expended on the camp has amounted to
  over £3,000,000. The men are exercised in marching, skirmishing, and
  similar field operations, which are carried on during the summer months
  with great activity; they are also instructed in the camp in cooking and
  other duties. The troops at Aldershot in summer include a number of
  Territorials, Senior and Junior O.T.C., &amp;c. The town is in the
  neighbourhood of the barracks, immediately beyond the Government ground,
  and in Hampshire. It contains several churches, and has schools,
  newspapers, literary institutes, music-halls &amp;c. Aldershot gives its
  name to a parliamentary division of Hants. Pop. (1921), 28,756.</p>

  <p><b>Ald&prime;helm,</b> an Anglo-Saxon scholar and prelate, Abbot of
  Malmesbury and Bishop of Sherborne, born 640 (?), died 709. He was a

  writings on theological subjects.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;dine Editions,</b> the name given to the works which
  proceeded from the press of Aldus Manutius and his family at Venice
  (1494-1592), Rome (1562-70), and Bologna. (See <i>Manutius</i>.)
  Recommended by their value, as well as by a splendid exterior, they have
  gained the respect of scholars and the attention of book-collectors. Many
  of them are the first printed editions (<i>editiones principes</i>) of
  Greek and Latin classics. Others are texts of the modern Italian authors.
  These editions are of importance in the history of printing. The editions
  printed by Aldus Manutius the Elder are, however, much more valuable than
  those issued by his descendants. Among the former are the first edition
  of the works of Aristotle in 5 vols., and the works of Virgil, Horace,
  and Petrarch. Aldus had nine kinds of Greek type, and no one before him
  printed so much and so beautifully in this language. Of the Latin
  character he procured fourteen kinds of type.</p>

  ancient fresco paintings, belonging probably to the time of Augustus,
  discovered in 1606 on Mount Aquilinus at the very spot where once were
  the gardens of Mæcenas, and acquired by Cardinal Aldobrandini, nephew of
  Clement VIII, now in the Vatican. It represents a marriage scene in which
  ten persons are portrayed. There is a beautiful copy of this fresco by

  death of Edward the Confessor he is said to have crowned Harold. Having
  submitted to the Conqueror, whose esteem he enjoyed and whose power he
  made subservient to the views of the Church, he also crowned him as well
  as Matilda.</p>

  <p><b>Aldrich,</b> Thomas Bailey, the most conspicuous American poet of
  his generation. Born at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 11th Nov., 1836;
  died at Boston in March, 1907. He edited <i>Every Saturday</i> in Boston
  from 1865 to 1874, and the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> from 1881 to 1890. He
  was a poet of some skill, the chief characteristic of his lyrics being
  refinement and finish. Some of his short stories have been rarely
  surpassed by other American writers. Among his volumes of verse are:
  <i>The Ballad of Babie Bell</i> (1856); <i>Cloth of Gold</i> (1874);
  <i>Lyrics and Sonnets</i> (1880); <i>Friar Jerome's Beautiful Book</i>
  (1881); <i>Unguarded Gates and other Poems</i> (1895), &amp;c. His prose
  works include: <i>Story of a Bad Boy</i> (1870); <i>Marjorie Daw and

  rests on his <i>Life and Adventures of the Rogue Guzman de Alfarache</i>
  (translated into French in 1600 and into English in 1623), one of the
  best of the <i>picaresque</i> or rogue novels, which give such a lively
  picture of the shady classes of society in Spain during the sixteenth and

  <p><b>Aleman&prime;ni,</b> or <b>Alamanni,</b> a confederacy of several
  German tribes which, at the commencement of the third century after
  Christ, lived near the Roman territory, and came then and subsequently
  into conflict with the imperial troops. Caracalla first fought with them
  in 213, but did not conquer them; Severus was likewise unsuccessful.
  About 250 they began to cross the Rhine westwards, and in 255 they
  overran Gaul along with the Franks. In 259 a body of them was defeated in
  Italy at Milan, and in the following year they were driven out of Gaul by
  Postumus. But the Alemanni did not desist from their incursions,
  notwithstanding the numerous defeats they suffered at the hands of the
  Roman troops. In the fourth century they crossed the Rhine and ravaged
  Gaul, but were severely defeated by the Emperor Julian and driven back.
  Subsequently they occupied a considerable territory on both sides of the
  Rhine; but at last Clovis broke their power in 496 and deprived them of a
  large portion of their possessions. Part of their territory was formed
  into a duchy called Alemannia or Swabia, this name being derived from
  Suevi or Swabians, the name which they gave themselves. It is from the
  Alemanni that the French have derived their names for Germans and Germany
  in general, namely, <i>Allemands</i> and <i>Allemagne</i>, though
  strictly speaking only the modern Swabians and northern Swiss are the
  proper descendants of that ancient race.</p>

  mathematician and philosopher, born in Paris, 16th Nov., 1717, and died
  there 29th Oct., 1783. He was the illegitimate son of Madame de Tencin
  and Chevalier Destouches, and was exposed at the Church of St. Jean le
  Rond (hence his name) soon after birth. He was brought up by the wife of
  a poor glazier, and with her he lived for more than forty years. His
  parents never publicly acknowledged him, but his father settled upon him
  an income of 1200 livres. He showed much quickness in learning, entered
  the College Mazarin at the age of twelve, and studied mathematics with
  enthusiasm and success, but received little encouragement from his
  teachers. Having left college he studied law and became an advocate, but
  did not practise, and long <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page94"></a>[94]</span>continued to occupy himself with
  mathematics, in which he made immense advances by his own efforts, often
  arriving at results that other mathematicians had previously arrived at
  unknown to him. A pamphlet on the motion of solid bodies in a fluid, and
  another on the integral calculus, which he laid before the Academy of
  Sciences in 1739 and 1740, showed him in so favourable a light that the
  Academy received him in 1741 into the number of its members. He soon
  after published his famous work on dynamics, <i>Traité de Dynamique</i>
  (1743) and another work dealing with fluids, <i>Traité des Fluides</i>.
  His <i>Réflexion sur la cause générale des vents</i> was also a work that
  added to D'Alembert's reputation. He also took a part in the
  investigations which completed the discoveries of Newton respecting the
  motion of the heavenly bodies, and published at intervals various
  important astronomical dissertations&mdash;on the perturbations of the
  planets, for instance, and on the precession of the equinoxes&mdash;as
  well as on other subjects. He also took part, with Diderot and others, in
  the celebrated <i>Encyclopédie</i> in 33 vols., for which he wrote the
  <i>Discours Préliminaire</i>, as well as many philosophical and almost
  all the mathematical articles. Literature, history, and philosophy also
  received attention from him, and his <i>Éléments de Philosophie</i>
  (1759), in which he agrees with the theories of Condillac and Locke, was
  a work of much value. His great philosophical aim seems to have been the
  idea of secularizing morality upon a rational basis. Among his
  miscellaneous works are <i>Mélanges de Philosophie, d'Histoire, et de
  Littérature</i>; <i>Traduction de quelques Morceaux choisis de
  Tacite</i>; <i>Sur la Destruction des Jésuites</i>; <i>Histoire des
  Membres de l'Académie Française</i>; <i>Éléments de Musique théorique et
  pratique</i>. He received an invitation from the Russian empress
  Catherine II to go to St. Petersburg (now Petrograd) as tutor to her son,
  a very large sum being offered; and Frederick the Great invited him to
  settle in Berlin, but in vain. From Frederick, however, he accepted a
  pension, and he also paid a visit to Berlin. There was an intimate
  friendship between him and Voltaire. He never married, but he was on
  terms of the closest friendship with Madame L'Espinasse, and they
  occupied the same house for a number of years. He was held in high esteem
  by David Hume, who left him a legacy of £200.</p>

  <p><b>Alem&prime;bic,</b> a simple apparatus sometimes used by chemists
  for distillation, and consisting of three main parts, body, head, and

  narrowing towards the top; the <i>head</i>, of a globular form, with a
  flat under-ring, fits on to the neck of the cucurbit, condenses the
  vapour from the heated liquid, and receives the distilled liquid on the
  ring enclosing the neck of the lower vessel, and thus causes it to find
  egress by a discharging-pipe into the third section, called the

  has been continued to Aleppo. Formerly the city was a great centre of
  trade and manufactures, but the earthquake and other causes have combined
  greatly to lessen its prosperity. It has still a trade, however, in the
  products of the country, such as wool, cotton, silk, wax, skins, soap,
  tobacco, &amp;c., and imports a certain quantity of European
  manufactures.&mdash;Aleppo was a place of considerable importance in very
  remote times. By the Greeks and Romans it was called <i>Ber&oelig;a</i>.
  It was conquered by the Arabs in 638, and its original name
  <i>Chalybon</i> was then turned into <i>Haleb</i>, whence the Italian
  form <i>Aleppo</i>. The town was occupied by British troops on 27th Oct.,
  1918. Its population, 200,000 at the beginning of last century, is now
  estimated at over 250,000. The language generally spoken is Arabic. The

    Coin of Alexander the Great
  </div>

  <p><b>Alexander,</b> surnamed <b>the Great,</b> was the son of Philip of
  Macedon and his queen Olympias, and was born at Pella, 356 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> In youth he had Aristotle as instructor, and he
  early displayed uncommon abilities. The victory of Chæronea in 338, which
  brought Greece entirely under Macedonia, was mainly decided by his
  efforts. Philip having been assassinated, 336 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, Alexander, not yet twenty years of age,
  ascended the throne. His father had been preparing an expedition against
  the Persians, and Alexander determined to carry it out; but before doing
  so he had to chastise the barbarian tribes on the frontiers of Macedon as
  well as quell a rising in Greece, in which he took and destroyed Thebes,
  put 6000 of the inhabitants to the sword, and carried 30,000 into
  captivity. Leaving Antipater to govern in his stead in Europe, and being
  confirmed as commander-in-chief of the Greek forces in the general
  assembly of the Greeks, he crossed over the Hellespont into Asia, in the
  spring of 334, with 30,000 foot and 5000 horse. His first encounter with
  the Persian forces (assisted by Greek mercenaries) was at the small river
  Gran&#x12B;cus, where he gained a complete victory. Most of the cities of
  Asia Minor now opened their gates to the victor, and Alexander restored
  democracy in all the Greek cities. In passing through Gordium he cut the
  Gordian knot, on which it was believed the fate <!-- Page 96 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>[96]</span>of Asia depended, and
  then conquered Lycia, Ionia, Caria, Pamphylia, and Cappadocia. A
  sickness, caused by bathing in the Cydnus (333 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), checked his progress; but scarcely was he
  restored to health when he continued his advance, and this same year
  defeated the Persian emperor Darius and his army of 500,000 or 600,000
  men (including 50,000 Greek mercenaries) near Issus (inner angle of the
  Gulf of Alexandretta). Darius fled towards the interior of his dominions,
  leaving his family and treasures to fall into the hands of the conqueror.
  Alexander did not pursue Darius, but proceeded southwards, and secured
  all the towns along the Mediterranean Sea, though he only got possession
  of Tyre (taken 332 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>) after besieging it for
  seven months. Palestine and Egypt now fell before him, and in the latter
  he founded Alexandria, which became one of the first cities of ancient
  times. Hence he went through the desert of Libya, to consult the oracle
  of Zeus Ammon, and it was said that the god recognized him as his son. On
  his return Alexander marched against Darius, who had collected an immense
  army in Assyria, and rejected the proposals of his rival for peace. A
  battle was fought at Gaugamela, about 50 miles from Arbela, 331 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>, and notwithstanding the immense numerical
  superiority of his enemy, Alexander (who had but 40,000 men and 7000
  horse) gained a complete victory. Babylon and Susa opened their gates to
  the conqueror, who marched towards Persepolis, the capital of Persia, and
  entered it in triumph. He now seems for a time to have lost his
  self-command. He gave himself up to arrogance and dissipation, and is
  said in a fit of intoxication to have set fire to the palace of
  Persepolis, one of the wonders of the world. Rousing himself up, however,
  he set out in pursuit of Darius, who, having lost his throne, was kept
  prisoner by Bessus, satrap of Bactriana. Bessus, on seeing himself
  closely pursued, caused Darius to be assassinated (330 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>). Continuing his progress he subdued Bessus, and
  advanced to the Jaxartes, the extreme eastern limit of the empire, but
  did not fully subdue the whole of this region till 328, some fortresses
  holding out with great tenacity. In one of these he took prisoner the
  beautiful Roxana, daughter of Oxyartes, a nobleman of Sogdiana, and
  having fallen in love with her he married her. Meantime disaffection had
  once or twice manifested itself among his Macedonian followers and had
  been cruelly punished; and he had also, to his lasting remorse, killed
  his faithful friend Cleitus in a fit of drunken rage. Alexander now
  formed the idea of conquering India, then scarcely known even by name. He
  passed the Indus (326 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), marched towards
  the Hydaspes (Jhelum), at the passage of which he conquered a king named
  Porus in a fierce battle, and advanced victoriously through the
  north-west of India, and intended to proceed as far as the Ganges, when
  the murmurs of his army compelled him to return. On the Hydaspes he built
  a fleet, in which he sent a part of his army down the river, while the
  rest proceeded along the banks. By the Hydaspes he reached the Acesines
  (Chenab), and thus the Indus, down which he sailed to the sea. Nearchus,
  his admiral, sailed hence to the Persian Gulf, while Alexander directed
  his march by land to Babylon, losing a great part of his troops in the
  desert through which he had to pass. In Susa he married Statira, the
  eldest daughter of Darius, and rewarded those of his Macedonians who had
  married Persian women, because it was his intention to unite the two
  nations as closely as possible. At Opis, on the Tigris, a mutiny arose
  among his Macedonians (in 324), who thought he showed too much favour to
  the Asiatics; by firmness and policy he succeeded in quelling this
  rising, and sent home 10,000 veterans with rich rewards. Soon after, his
  favourite, Hephæstion, died at Ecbatana, and Alexander's grief was
  unbounded. The favourite was royally buried at Babylon, and here
  Alexander was engaged in extensive plans for the future, when he became
  suddenly sick, after a banquet, and died in a few days (323 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), in his thirty-third year, after a reign of
  twelve years and eight months. His body was after a time conveyed to
  Egypt with great splendour by his general Ptolemy. He left behind him an
  immense empire, which was divided among his chief generals, and became
  the scene of continual wars. The reign of Alexander constitutes an
  important period in the history of humanity. His career was not merely a
  series of empty conquests, but was attended with the most important
  results. The language, and much of the civilization of Greece, followed
  in his track; large additions were made to the sciences of geography,
  natural history, &amp;c.; a road was opened to India; and the products of
  the farthest east were introduced into Europe. Greek kingdoms, under his
  generals and their successors, continued to exist in Asia for
  centuries.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: B.&nbsp;I. Wheeler,

  <p><b>Alexander,</b> the name of eight popes, the <!-- Page 97 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page97"></a>[97]</span>earliest of whom,
  <b>Alexander I,</b> is said to have reigned from 108 to 119. <b>Alexander
  III,</b> elected 1159, died 1181, exercised his authority with great
  vigour against Henry II when the latter was accused of the assassination
  of Thomas Becket. The most famous (or infamous) is <b>Alexander VI</b>
  (Borgia), who was born at Valencia, in Spain, in 1431, and died in 1503.
  When he was only twenty-five years of age his uncle, Pope Calixtus III,
  made him a cardinal, and shortly afterwards appointed him to the
  dignified and lucrative office of vice-chancellor. By bribery he prepared
  his way to the papal throne, which he attained in 1492, after the death
  of Innocent VIII. Both the authority and revenues of the popes being at
  this time much impaired, he set himself to reduce the power of the
  Italian princes, and seize upon their possessions for the benefit of his
  own family. To effect this end he is said not to have scrupled to use the
  vilest means, including poison and assassination. His policy, foreign as
  well as domestic, was faithless and base, and his private life was
  stained by immorality. He understood how to extract immense sums of money
  from all Christian countries under various pretexts. He sold indulgences,
  and set aside, in favour of himself, the wills of several cardinals. His
  excesses roused against him the powerful eloquence of Savonarola, who, by
  pen and pulpit, urged his deposition, but had to meet his death at the
  stake in 1498. Not long after his election Alexander had the honour of
  deciding the dispute between the kings of Portugal and Castile concerning
  their respective claims to the foreign countries recently discovered. It
  must, however, be admitted that Pope Alexander, whilst striking the
  wealthy and powerful, interested himself in the welfare of the people,
  and that he was a patron of arts and letters. His son, Cesare Borgia, and
  his daughter, Lucrezia, are equally notorious with himself.</p>

  <p><b>Alexander,</b> the name of three Scottish kings. <b>Alexander
  I,</b> a son of Malcolm III, Canmore, and Margaret of England, succeeded
  his brother Edgar in 1107, and governed with great ability till his death
  in 1124. He was a great benefactor of the Church, and a firm vindicator
  of the national independence.&mdash;<b>Alexander II</b> was born in 1198,
  and succeeded his father, William the Lion, in 1214. He was a wise and
  energetic prince, and Scotland prospered greatly under him, though
  disturbed by the Norsemen, by the restlessness of some of the Celtic
  chiefs, and by the attempts of Henry III of England to make Alexander do
  homage to him. He helped Robert FitzWilliam to capture London and compel
  King John to sign Magna Charta. Alexander married Henry's sister, Joan,
  in 1221, who lived till 1238. In 1244 war with England almost broke out,
  but was fortunately averted. Alexander died in 1248 at Kerrera, an island
  opposite Oban, when on an expedition in which he hoped to wrest the
  Hebrides from Norway. He was succeeded by his son, <b>Alexander III,</b>
  a boy of eight, who in 1251 married Margaret, eldest daughter of Henry
  III of England. Like his father, he was eager to bring the Hebrides under
  his sway, and this he was enabled to accomplish in a few years after the
  defeat of the Norse King Haco at Largs, in 1263. The mainland and islands
  of Scotland were now under one sovereign, though Orkney and Shetland
  still belonged to Norway. Alexander was strenuous in asserting the
  independence both of the Scottish kingdom and the Scottish Church against
  England. He died in 1285 by the falling of his horse while he was riding
  in the dark between Burntisland and Kinghorn. He left as his heiress
  Margaret, the Maid of Norway, daughter of Eric of Norway, and of
  Alexander's daughter, Margaret. Under him Scotland enjoyed greater
  prosperity than for generations afterwards.</p>

  <p><b>Alexander I,</b> Emperor of Russia, son of Paul I and Maria,
  daughter of Prince Eugene of Würtemberg, was born in 1777, and died in
  1825. On the assassination of his father, in 1801, Alexander ascended the
  throne, and one of his first acts was to conclude peace with Britain,
  against which his predecessor had declared war. In 1803 he offered his
  services as mediator between England and France, and two years later a
  convention was entered into between Russia, England, Austria, and Sweden
  for the purpose of resisting the encroachments of France on the
  territories of independent States. He was present at the battle of
  Austerlitz (1805), when the combined armies of Russia and Austria were
  defeated by Napoleon. In the succeeding campaign the Russians were again
  beaten at Eylau (8th Feb., 1807) and Friedland (14th June), the result of
  which was an interview between Alexander and Napoleon, and the treaty at
  Tilsit. The Russian emperor now for a time identified himself with the
  Napoleonic schemes, and soon obtained possession of Finland and an
  extended territory on the Danube. The French alliance, however, he found
  to be too oppressive, and his having separated himself from Napoleon led
  to the disastrous French invasion of 1812. In 1813 he published a
  manifesto which served as the basis of the coalition of the other
  European powers against France, which was followed by the capture of
  Paris (in 1814), the abdication of Napoleon and the restoration of the
  Bourbons, and the utter overthrow of Napoleon the following year. After
  Waterloo, Alexander, accompanied by the Emperor of Austria and the King
  of Prussia, made his second entrance into Paris, where they concluded the
  treaty known as the <!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page98"></a>[98]</span>Holy Alliance. The remaining part of his
  reign was chiefly taken up with measures of internal reform, including
  the gradual abolition of serfdom, and the promotion of education,
  agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, as well as literature and the
  fine arts.</p>

  <p><b>Alexander II,</b> Emperor of Russia, was born 29th April, 1818, and
  succeeded his father Nicholas in 1855, before the end of the Crimean war.
  After peace was concluded, the new emperor set about effecting reforms in
  the empire, the greatest of all being the emancipation of the serfs in
  1861, a measure which gave freedom, on certain conditions, to 50,000,000
  of human beings who were previously in a state little removed from that
  of slavery. Under him, too, representative assemblies in the provinces
  were introduced, and he also did much to improve education, and to
  reorganize the judicial system. During his reign the Russian dominions in
  Central Asia were extended, a piece of territory south of the Caucasus,
  formerly belonging to Turkey, was acquired, and a part of Bessarabia
  restored to Russia. The latter additions resulted from the Russo-Turkish
  war of 1877-8. He was killed by an explosive missile flung at him by a
  Nihilist in a street in St. Petersburg (now Petrograd), 13th March, 1881.
  He was succeeded by his son, Alexander III. His only daughter was married
  to the Duke of Edinburgh.</p>

  <p><b>Alexander III,</b> Emperor of Russia, son of Alexander II, born in
  1845, became heir to the throne on the death of his eldest brother,
  Nicholas (1865). In 1863 he married Princess Dagmar of Denmark; he
  succeeded to the throne in 1881, on the assassination of his father,
  being crowned in Moscow in 1883. He gave up the reforms begun by his
  father, and ruled in the old autocratic fashion, restricting the
  liberties of Finland and the Baltic Provinces, and encouraging
  persecution of the Jews. He spent much time in the closely-guarded castle
  of Gatchina, to be safe from Nihilistic attempts, several of which he
  narrowly escaped. He endeavoured to put down corruption and underhand
  dealing among the bureaucracy, and in his own habits gave an example of
  simplicity and economy. While showing himself suspicious of Germany and
  Austria-Hungary, he entered on friendly relations with France. He began
  to suffer from disease of the kidneys in 1893, and died at Livadia on 1st
  Nov., 1894. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Nicholas II.</p>

  <p><b>Alexander I,</b> King of Serbia, born in 1876. He was the son of
  King Milan, and on the abdication of his father in 1889 was proclaimed
  king under a regency. He married Madame Draga Mashin, a widow, who was
  much older than himself. Both were assassinated on 11th June, 1903.</p>

  <p><b>Alexander,</b> Boyd, British explorer and naturalist, born in 1873.
  He led many expeditions for research and exploration to the Cape Verde
  Islands, the Zambesi River, and various parts of the world. He also
  discovered many new birds when he ascended the Mount St. Isabel. In 1908
  he received the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society. He was
  murdered by natives in May, 1910, while exploring the French Congo. He
  wrote <i>From the Niger to the Nile</i> (1907), &amp;c. <i>Boyd
  Alexander's Last Journey</i> was published in 1912.</p>

  <p><b>Alexander Nevskoi,</b> a Russian hero and saint, son of the
  Grand-Duke Jaroslav, born in 1219, died in 1263. He fought valiantly
  against assaults of the Mongols, the Danes, Swedes, and Knights of the
  Teutonic Order. He gained the name of <i>Nevskoi</i> in 1240, for a
  splendid victory, on the Neva, over the Swedes. The gratitude of his
  countrymen commemorated the hero in popular songs, and raised him to the
  dignity of a saint. Peter the Great built a splendid monastery at St.
  Petersburg (Petrograd) in his honour, and in memory of him established
  the Order of Alexander Nevskoi.</p>

  <p><b>Alexander Seve&prime;rus,</b> a Roman emperor, born in 208, died
  <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 235. He was raised to the imperial dignity
  in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 222 by the prætorian guards, after they
  had put his cousin the Emperor Heliogabalus to death. He governed ably
  both in peace and war; and also occupied himself in poetry, philosophy,
  and literature. He was very tolerant in religious matters, and although
  not professing Christianity intended to erect a temple to Christ, but was
  prevented by the pagan priests from carrying out this plan. In 232 he
  defeated the Persians under Artaxerxes, who wished to drive the Romans
  from Asia. When on an expedition into Gaul, to repress an incursion of
  the Germans, he was murdered with his mother in an insurrection of his
  troops, headed by the brutal Maximin, who succeeded him as emperor.</p>

  <p><b>Alexanders</b> (<i>Smyrnium Olus&#x101;trum</i>), an umbelliferous

  Britain and Ireland. It was formerly cultivated for its leaf-stalks,
  which, having a pleasant aromatic flavour, were blanched and used instead
  of celery&mdash;a vegetable that has taken its place.</p>

  <p><b>Alexandra,</b> the queen mother, widow of Edward VII, daughter of
  Christian IX, King of Denmark, was born at Copenhagen on 1st Dec., 1844,
  and was married on 10th March, 1863, being Princess of Wales up to the
  death of Queen Victoria and the accession of King Edward in Jan., 1901.
  She was highly popular from the first in the country of her husband, as
  she constantly showed an interest in all <!-- Page 99 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>[99]</span>benevolent causes. She
  has been the mother of six children, one of whom died in infancy, while
  the eldest, Edward, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, died in 1892 at the
  age of twenty-eight. Cf. S.&nbsp;A. Tooley, <i>Queen Alexandra</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Alexandret&prime;ta,</b> or <b>Iskanderoon</b> (ancient
  <b>Alexandria ad Issum</b>), a small seaport in Asia Minor, on the Gulf
  of Iskanderoon, the port of Aleppo and Northern Syria. Named after
  Alexander the Great, and founded in memory of the battle of Issus. In
  1832 Mehemet Ali won a victory over the Turks near Alexandretta. There is
  a large export and import trade. It was occupied by British and French
  troops in Nov., 1918. Pop. 10,000.</p>

  <p><b>Alexan&prime;dria,</b> an ancient city and seaport in Egypt, at the
  north-west angle of the Nile delta, on a ridge of land between the sea
  and Lake Mareotis. Ancient Alexandria was founded by, and named in honour
  of, Alexander the Great, in 332 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>, and was
  long a great and splendid city, the centre of commerce between the east
  and west, as well as of Greek learning and civilization, with a
  population at one time of perhaps 1,000,000. It was especially celebrated
  for its great library, and also for its famous lighthouse, one of the
  wonders of the world, standing upon the little island of Pharos, which
  was connected with the city by a mole. Under Roman rule it was the second
  city of the empire, and when Constantinople became the capital of the
  East it still remained the chief centre of trade; but it received a blow
  from which it never recovered when captured by Amru, general of Caliph
  Omar, in 641, after a siege of fourteen months. Its ruin was finally
  completed by the building of Cairo (969) and the discovery of the passage
  to India by the Cape of Good Hope (1498) which opened up a new route for
  the Asiatic trade. See <i>Alexandrian Library</i>, <i>Alexandrian
  School</i>.&mdash;Modern Alexandria stands partly on what was formerly
  the island of Pharos, partly on the peninsula which now connects it with
  the mainland and which was formed by the accumulation of soil, and partly
  on the mainland. The streets in the Turkish quarter are narrow, dirty,
  and irregular; in the foreign quarter they are regular and wide, and it
  is here that the finest houses are situated. Here also are the principal
  shops and hotels, banks, offices of companies, &amp;c.; this part of the
  city being supplied with gas, and with water brought by the Mahmudieh
  Canal from the western branch of the Nile. Alexandria is connected by
  railway with Cairo, Rosetta, and Suez. A little to the south of the city
  are the catacombs, which now serve as a quarry. Another relic of
  antiquity is Pompey's Pillar, 98 feet 9 inches high. Alexandria has two
  ports, on the east and west respectively of the isthmus of the Pharos
  peninsula, the latter having a breakwater over 3000 yards in length, with
  fine quays and suitable railway and other accommodation. The trade of
  Alexandria is large and varied, the exports being cotton, beans, pease,
  rice, wheat, &amp;c.; the imports chiefly manufactured goods, machinery,
  timber, and coal. The origin of its more recent career of prosperity it
  owes to Mohammed Ali. In 1882 the insurrection of Arabi Pasha and the
  massacre of Europeans led to the intervention of the British, and the
  bombardment of the forts by the British fleet in July. The administrative
  district has an area of 19 sq. miles; pop. 444,617 (or 23,401 per square
  mile).</p>

  <p><b>Alexandria,</b> a town and port of the United States, in Virginia,
  on the right bank of the Potomac (which is of sufficient depth for large

  <p><b>Alexandrian Library,</b> the largest and most famous of all the
  ancient collections of books, founded by Ptolemy Soter (died 283 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>), King of Egypt, and greatly enlarged by
  succeeding Ptolemies. The first librarian was Zenodotus (234 <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span>). At its most flourishing period it is said to
  have numbered 700,000 volumes, accommodated in two different buildings,
  one of them being the Serapeion, or temple of Jupiter Serapis. The other
  collection was burned during Julius Cæsar's siege of the city, but the
  Serapeion library existed to the time of the Emperor Theodosius the
  Great, when, at the general destruction of the heathen temples, the
  splendid temple of Jupiter Serapis was gutted (<span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 391) by a fanatical crowd of Christians, and its
  literary treasures destroyed or scattered. A library was again
  accumulated, but was burned by the Arabs when they captured the city
  under the caliph Omar in 641. Amru, the captain of the caliph's army,
  would have been willing to spare the library, but Omar is said to have
  disposed of the matter in the famous words: "If these writings of the
  Greeks agree with the Koran they are useless, and need not be preserved;
  if they disagree they are pernicious, and ought to be destroyed". This
  story, however, which rests solely on the authority of Abulfaragius, a
  writer who lived six centuries later, is now generally discredited.</p>

  name="page100"></a>[100]</span>hundred years that the rule of the
  Ptolemies lasted (323-30 <span class="scac">B.C.</span>), and continued
  under the Roman supremacy. Ptolemy Soter founded the famous library of
  Alexandria (see above) and his son, Philadelphus, established a kind of
  academy of sciences and arts. Many scholars and men of genius were thus
  attracted to Alexandria, and a period of literary activity set in, which
  made Alexandria for long the focus and centre of Greek culture and
  intellectual effort. It must be admitted, however, that originality was
  not a characteristic of the Alexandrian age, which was stronger in
  criticism, grammar, and science than in pure literature. Among the
  grammarians and critics were Zenodotus, Eratosthenes, Aristophanes,
  Aristarchus, and Zoilus, proverbial as a captious critic. Their merit is
  to have collected, edited, and preserved the existing monuments of Greek
  literature. To the poets belong Apollonius, Lycophron, Aratus, Nicander,
  Euphorion, Callimachus, Theocritus, Philetas, &amp;c. Among those who
  pursued mathematics, physics, and astronomy was Euclid, the father of
  scientific geometry; Archimedes, great in physics and mechanics;
  Apollonius of Perga, whose work on conic sections still exists;
  Nicomachus, the first scientific arithmetician; and (under the Romans)
  the astronomer and geographer Ptolemy. Alexandria also was distinguished
  in philosophical speculation, and it was here that the New Platonic
  school was established by Ammonius of Alexandria (about <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 193), whose disciples were Plotinus and Origen.
  Being for the most part Orientals, formed by the study of Greek learning,
  the writings of the New Platonists are strikingly characterized&mdash;for
  example, those of Ammonius Saccas, Plotinus, Iamblicus,
  Porphyrius&mdash;by a mixture of Asiatic and European elements. The
  connection of Neo-Platonism with Alexandria is, however, less than is
  commonly supposed.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Mahaffy,

  <p><b>Alexandrine,</b> in prosody, the name given, from an old French
  poem on Alexander the Great, to a species of verse, which consists of six
  iambic feet, or twelve syllables, the pause being, in correct
  Alexandrines, always on the sixth syllable; for example, the second of
  the following verses:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>A needless Alexandrine ends the song,</p>
      <p>That, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In English Drayton's <i>Polyolbion</i> is written in this measure, and
  the concluding line of the Spenserian stanza is an Alexandrine. In France
  the verse fell into disuse during the early part of the sixteenth
  century, but was again revived by Jean Antoine de Baïf, one of the poets
  of the Pléiade. Jodelle introduced the verse into the drama, and Ronsard
  made it very popular. French epics and dramas being confined to this
  verse, it is therefore called the <i>heroic</i>.</p>

  internal administration and for the enlargement of the empire;
  reconquered Little Russia from Poland, and carried his authority to the
  extreme east of Siberia. He was father of sixteen children, the most
  famous of them being Peter the Great and his sister Sophia.</p>

  <p><b>Alexis Petro&prime;vitsh,</b> eldest son of Peter the Great and

  in 1718. He opposed the innovations introduced by his father, who on this
  account disinherited him by a ukase in 1718, and when he discovered that
  Alexis was paving the way to succeed to the crown he had his son tried
  and condemned to death. A few days afterwards Alexis died, after having
  received twenty-five strokes with the knout, leaving a son, afterwards
  the Emperor Peter II.</p>

  menaced from various sides, especially by the Turks and the Normans. From
  these dangers he managed to extricate himself by policy or warlike
  measures, and maintained his position till the age of seventy, during a
  reign of thirty-seven years. His daughter Anna wrote a life of him
  (<i>The Alexiad</i>), which is one continuous eulogy, but all the Latin
  historians are very severe on him.</p>

  <p><b>Alfieri</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>l-f&#x113;-&#x101;&prime;r&#x113;),
  Vittorio, Count, Italian poet, was born at Asti in 1749, and died in
  1803. After extensive European travels he began to write, and his first
  play, <i>Cleopatra</i> (1775), being received with general applause he
  determined to devote all his efforts to attaining a position among
  writers of dramatic poetry. At Florence he became intimate with the
  Countess of Albany, wife of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, and on the
  death of the prince she lived with him as his mistress. This connection
  he believed to have served to stimulate and elevate his poetic powers. He
  died at Florence and was buried in the church of Santa Croce, between
  Macchiavelli and Michael Angelo, where a beautiful monument by Canova
  covers his remains. He wrote twenty-one tragedies and six comedies. His
  theatrical work has been rightly styled a creation of his pride as much
  as of his genius; he endeavoured to turn the theatre into a platform and
  was constantly preaching from the stage. Anxious to use his characters as
  exponents of his theories, and to make them <i>talk</i>, he often forgot
  to make them <i>act</i>. Alfieri himself admitted that he was writing
  with a view to "teaching men how to become free, strong, generous, and
  passionate for real virtue", but such an attitude is opposed to true art.
  His tragedies are full of lofty and patriotic sentiments, but the
  language is stiff and without poetic grace, and the plots poor.
  Nevertheless he is considered the first tragic writer of Italy, and has
  served as a model for his successors. Alfieri composed also an epic,
  lyrics, satires, and poetical translations from the ancient classics. He
  left an interesting autobiography. The best edition of his works is that
  published at Pisa (1805-13) in 22 vols.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;fred</b> (or <b>Æl&prime;fred</b>) <b>the Great,</b> King
  of England, was born at Wantage, in Berkshire, <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 849, his father being Ethelwulf, son of Egbert,
  King of the West Saxons. He succeeded his brother Ethelred in 872, at a
  time when the Danes, or Northmen, had extended their conquests widely
  over the country, and they had completely overrun the kingdom of the West
  Saxons by 878. Alfred was obliged to flee in disguise. At length he
  gathered a small force, and having fortified himself on the Isle of
  Athelney, formed by the confluence of the Rivers Parret and Tone, amid
  the marshes of Somerset, he was able to make frequent sallies against the
  enemy. It was during his abode here that he went, according to legend,
  disguised as a harper into the camp of King Guthrum (or Guthorm), and,
  having ascertained that the Danes felt themselves secure, hastened back
  to his troops, led them against the enemy, and gained such a decided
  victory that fourteen days afterwards the Danes begged for peace. This
  battle took place in May, 878, near Edington, in Wiltshire. Alfred
  allowed the Danes who were already in the country to remain, on condition
  that they gave hostages, took a solemn oath to quit Wessex, and embraced
  Christianity. Their king, Guthrum, was baptized, with thirty of his
  followers, and ever afterward remained faithful to Alfred. They received
  that portion of the east of England now occupied by the counties of
  Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridge, as a place of residence. The few years
  of tranquillity (886-93) which followed were employed by Alfred in
  rebuilding the towns that had suffered most during the war, particularly
  London; in training his people in arms and no less in agriculture; in
  improving the navy; in systematizing the laws and internal
  administration; and in literary labours and the advancement of learning.
  He caused many manuscripts to be translated from Latin, and himself
  translated several works into Anglo-Saxon, such as the <i>Psalms</i>,
  <i>Æsop's Fables</i>, <i>Boethius on the Consolation of Philosophy</i>,
  the <i>History of Orosius</i>, <i>Bede's Ecclesiastical History</i>,
  &amp;c. He also drew up several original works in Anglo-Saxon. These
  peaceful labours were interrupted, about 894, by an invasion of the
  Northmen, who, after a struggle of three years, were finally driven out.
  Alfred died in 901. He had married, in 868, Alswith or Ealhswith, the
  daughter of a Mercian nobleman, and left two sons: Edward, who succeeded
  him, and <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  thallogenous plants, found for the most part in the sea and fresh water,
  or on the surface of damp walls, rocks, the bark of trees, and in similar
  moist situations. They are either some shade of bluish-green, green,
  brown, or red colour. The higher forms have stems bearing leaf-like
  expansions, and they are often attached to the rocks by roots, which,
  however, do not derive nutriment from the rocks. A stem, however, is most
  frequently absent. The plants are nourished through their whole surface
  by the medium in which they live. They vary in size from the microscopic
  diatoms to forms whose stems resemble those of forest trees, and whose
  fronds rival the leaves of the palm. They are entirely composed of
  cellular tissue, and many are edible and nutritious, as carrageen or
  Irish-moss, dulse, &amp;c. Kelp, iodine, and bromine are products of
  various species. The Algæ are also valuable as manure. They are often
  divided into five orders: Diatomaceæ, Confervaceæ, Fucaceæ, Ceramiaceæ,
  and Characeæ.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;gebra</b> (from the Arabic <i>al</i>, definite article,
  and <i>jabbara</i>, to make equal), a kind of generalized arithmetic, in
  which numbers or quantities and operations, often also the results of
  operations, are represented by symbols. Thus the expression <i>xy</i> +
  <i>cz</i> + <i>dy</i><sup>2</sup> denotes that a number represented by
  <i>x</i> is to be multiplied by a number represented by <i>y</i>, a
  number <i>c</i> multiplied by a number <i>z</i>, a number <i>d</i> by a
  number <i>y</i> multiplied by itself (or squared), and the sum taken of
  these three products. So the <i>equation</i> (as it is called)
  <i>x<sup>2</sup></i> - 7<i>x</i> + 12 = 0 expresses the fact that if a
  certain number <i>x</i> is multiplied by itself, and this result made
  less by seven times the number and greater by twelve, the result is 0. In
  this case <i>x</i> must either be 3 or 4 to produce the given result; but
  such an equation (or formula) as (<i>a</i> + <i>b</i>)(<i>a</i> -
  <i>b</i>) = <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> - <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> is always true
  whatever values may be assigned to <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. Algebra is an
  invaluable instrument in intricate calculations of all kinds, and enables
  operations to be performed and results obtained that by arithmetic would
  be impossible, and its scope is still being extended.</p>

  <p>The beginnings of algebraic method are to be found in Diophantus, a
  Greek of the fourth century of our era, but it was the Arabians that
  introduced algebra to Europe, and from them it received its name. The
  first Arabian treatise on algebra was published in the reign of the great
  Caliph Al Mamun (813-33) by Mohammed Ben Musa. Italian merchants were the
  first algebraists in Europe, and in 1202 Leonardo Fibonacci of Pisa, who
  had travelled and studied in the East, published a work treating of
  algebra as then understood in the Arabian school. From this time to the
  discovery of printing considerable attention was given to algebra, and
  the work of Ben Musa and another Arabian treatise, called the <i>Rule of
  Algebra</i>, were translated into Italian. The first printed work
  treating on algebra (also on arithmetic, &amp;c.) appeared at Venice in
  1494, the author being a monk called Luca Pacioli da Bergo, a Minorite
  friar. Rapid progress now began to be made, and among the names of those
  to whom advances are to be attributed are Tartaglia and Geronimo Cardano.
  About the middle of the sixteenth century the German Stifel introduced
  the signs +, -, &radic;, and Robert Recorde the sign =. The last-named
  wrote the first English work on algebra in 1557. François <!-- Page 103
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>[103]</span>Vieta, a
  French mathematician (1540-1603), first adopted the method which has led
  to so great an extension of modern algebra, by being the first who used
  general symbols for known quantities as well as for unknown. It was he
  also who first made the application of algebra to geometry. Albert
  Girard, a Flemish mathematician in the seventeenth century, extended the
  theory of equations by the introduction of imaginary quantities. The
  Englishman Harriot, early in the seventeenth century, discovered negative
  roots, and established the equality between the number of roots and the
  units in the degree of the equation. He also invented the signs &lt; >,
  and Oughtred that of ×. Descartes, though not the first to apply algebra
  to geometry, has, by the extent and importance of his applications,
  commonly acquired the credit of being so. The same discoveries have also
  been attributed to him as to Harriot, and their respective claims have
  caused much controversy. He obtained by means of algebra the definition
  and description of curves. Since his time algebra has been applied so
  widely in geometry and higher mathematics that we need only mention the
  names of Fermat, Wallis, Newton, Leibnitz, De Moivre, MacLaurin, Taylor,
  Euler, D'Alembert, Lagrange, Laplace, Fourier, Poisson, Gauss, Horner, De
  Morgan, Sylvester, Cayley. Boole, Jevons, and others have applied the
  algebraic method not only to formal logic but to political
  economy.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: Chrystal,

  <p><b>Alge&prime;ria,</b> a French dependency in N. Africa, having on the
  north the Mediterranean, on the east Tunis, on the west Morocco, and on
  the south the Desert of Sahara; area, 122,878 sq. miles, or including the
  Algerian Sahara 343,500. The country is divided into three
  departments&mdash;Algiers, Oran, and Constantine. The coastline is about
  550 miles in length, steep and rocky, and though the indentations are
  numerous, the harbours are much exposed to the north wind. The country is
  traversed by the Atlas Mountains, two chains of which&mdash;the Great
  Atlas, bordering on the Sahara, and the Little, or Maritime Atlas,
  between it and the sea&mdash;run parallel to the coast, the former
  attaining a height of 7000 feet. The intervals are filled with lower
  ranges, and numerous transverse ranges connect the principal ones and run
  from them to the coast, forming elevated tablelands and enclosed valleys.
  The rivers are numerous, but many of them are mere torrents rising in the
  mountains near the coast. The Shelif is much the largest. Some of the
  rivers are largely used for irrigation, and artesian wells have been sunk
  in some places for the same purpose. There are, both on the coast and in
  the interior, extensive salt lakes or marshes (<i>Shotts</i>), which dry
  up to a great extent in summer. The country bordering on the coast,
  called the <i>Tell</i>, is generally hilly, with fertile valleys; in some
  places a flat and fertile plain extends between the hills and the sea. In
  the east there are <i>Shotts</i> that sink below the sea-level, and into
  these it has been proposed to introduce the waters of the Mediterranean.
  The climate varies considerably according to elevation and local
  peculiarities. There are three seasons: winter from November to February,
  spring from March to June, and summer from July to October. The summer is
  very hot and dry. In many parts of the coast the temperature is moderate
  and the climate so healthy that Algeria is now a winter resort for
  invalids.</p>

  <p>The chief products of cultivation are wheat, barley, and oats,
  tobacco, cotton, wine, silk, and dates. Early vegetables, especially
  potatoes and pease, are exported to France and England. A fibre called
  <i>alfa</i>, a variety of esparto, which grows wild on the high plateaux,
  is exported in large quantities. Cork is also exported. There are
  valuable forests, in which grow various sorts of pines and oaks, ash,
  cedar, myrtle, pistachio-nut, mastic, carob, &amp;c. The Australian
  <i>Eucalyptus glob&#x16D;lus</i> (a gum tree) has been successfully
  introduced. Agriculture often suffers much from the ravages of locusts.
  Among wild animals are the lion, panther, hyena, and jackal; the domestic
  quadrupeds include the horse, the mule, cattle, sheep, and pigs
  (introduced by the French). Algeria possesses valuable minerals,
  including iron, copper, lead, sulphur, zinc, antimony, marble (white and
  red), phosphate, and lithographic stone.</p>

  <p>The trade of Algeria has greatly increased under French rule, France,
  Spain, and England being the countries with which it is principally
  carried on, and three-fourths of the whole being with France. The exports
  (besides those mentioned above) are olive-oil, raw hides, wood, wool,
  tobacco, oranges, &amp;c.; the imports, manufactured goods, wines,
  spirits, coffee, &amp;c. The manufacturing industries are unimportant,
  and include morocco leather, carpets, muslins, and silks. French money,
  weights, and measures are <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page104"></a>[104]</span>generally used. The chief towns are
  Algiers, Oran, Constantine, Bona, and Tlemsen. There are about 2800 miles
  of railways opened; there is also a considerable network of telegraph
  lines.</p>

  <p>The two principal native races inhabiting Algeria are Arabs and
  Berbers. The former are mostly nomads, dwelling in tents and wandering
  from place to place, though a large number of them are settled in the
  Tell, where they carry on agriculture and have formed numerous villages.
  The Berbers, here called Kabyles, are the original inhabitants of the
  territory and still form a considerable part of the population. They
  speak the Berber language, but use Arabic characters in writing. The Jews
  form a small but influential part of the population. Various other races
  also exist. Except the Jews, all the native races are Mahommedans. There
  are now a considerable number of French and other colonists, provision
  being made for granting them concessions of land on certain conditions.
  There are over 260,000 colonists of French origin in Algeria, and over
  200,000 colonists natives of other European countries (chiefly Spaniards
  and Italians). Algeria is governed by a governor-general, who is assisted
  by a council appointed by the French Government. The settled portion of
  the country, in the three departments of Algiers, Constantine, and Oran,
  is treated much as if it were a part of France, and each department sends
  two deputies and one senator to the French chambers. The rest of the
  territory is under military rule. The colony costs France a considerable
  sum every year. Pop. of Algeria proper in 1911, 5,523,449; of the
  Algerian Sahara, 40,379.</p>

  <p>The country now called Algeria was known to the Romans as Numidia. It
  flourished greatly under their rule, and early received the Christian
  religion. It was conquered by the Vandals in <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 430-1, and recovered by Belisarius for the
  Byzantine Empire in 533-4. About the middle of the seventh century it was
  overrun by the Saracens. The town of Algiers was founded about 935 by
  Yussef Ibn Zeiri, and the country was subsequently ruled by his
  successors and the dynasties of the Almoravides and Almohades. After the
  overthrow of the latter, about 1269, it broke up into a number of small
  independent territories. The Moors and Jews, who were driven out of Spain
  by Ferdinand and Isabella at the end of the fifteenth century, settled in
  large numbers in Algeria, and revenged themselves on their persecutors by
  the practice of piracy. On this account various expeditions were made by
  Spain against Algeria, and by 1510 the greater part of the country was
  made tributary. A few years later the Algerians invited to their
  assistance the Turkish pirate Horush (or Haruj) Barbarossa, who made
  himself Sultan of Algiers in 1516, but was not long in being taken by the
  Spaniards and beheaded. His brother and successor put Algiers under the
  protection of Turkey (about 1520), and organized the system of piracy
  which was long the terror of European commerce, and was never wholly
  suppressed till the French occupation. Henceforth the country belonged to
  the Turkish Empire, though from 1710 the connection was little more than
  nominal. The depredations of the Algerian pirates were a continual source
  of irritation to the Christian Powers, who sent a long series of
  expeditions against them. For instance, in 1815 a United States fleet
  defeated an Algerian one and forced the Dey to agree to a peace in which
  he recognized the American flag as inviolable. In 1816 Lord Exmouth with
  an English fleet bombarded Algiers, and exacted a treaty by which all the
  Christian slaves were at once released, and the Dey undertook for the
  future to treat all his prisoners of war as the European law of nations
  demanded. But the piratical practices of the Algerians were soon
  renewed.</p>

  <p>At last the French determined on more vigorous measures, and in 1830
  sent a force of over 40,000 men against the country. Algiers was speedily
  occupied, the Dey retired, and the country was without a government, but
  resistance was organized by Abd-el-Kader, an Arab chief whom the
  emergency had raised up. He began his warlike career of fifteen years by
  an attack on Oran in 1832, and after an obstinate struggle the French, in
  Feb., 1834, consented to a peace, acknowledging him as ruling over all
  the Arab tribes west of the Shelif by the title of Emir of Maskara. War
  was soon again renewed with varying fortune, and in 1837, in order to
  have their hands free in attacking Constantine, the French made peace
  with Abd-el-Kader, leaving to him the whole of Western Algeria except
  some coast towns. Constantine was now taken, and the subjugation of the
  province of Constantine followed. Meanwhile Abd-el-Kader was preparing
  for another conflict, and in Nov., 1838, he suddenly broke into French
  territory with a strong force, and for a time the supremacy of the French
  was endangered. Matters took a more favourable turn for them when General
  Bugeaud was appointed governor-general in Feb., 1841. In the autumn of
  1841 Saida, the last fortress of Abd-el-Kader, fell into his hands, after
  which the only region that held out against the French was that bordering
  on Morocco. Early in the following year this also was conquered, and
  Abd-el-Kader found himself compelled to seek refuge in the adjoining
  empire. From Morocco Abd-el-Kader twice made a descent upon Algeria, on
  the second occasion defeating the French in two battles; and in 1844 he
  even succeeded in raising an army in Morocco to withstand the <!-- Page
  105 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>[105]</span>French.
  Bugeaud, however, crossed the frontier, and inflicted a severe defeat on
  this army, while a French fleet bombarded the towns on the coast. The
  Emperor of Morocco was at length compelled to agree to a treaty, in which
  he not only promised to refuse Abd-el-Kader his assistance, but even
  engaged to lend his assistance against him. Reduced to extremities
  Abd-el-Kader surrendered on 27th Dec., 1847, and was at first taken to
  France a prisoner, but was afterwards released on his promise not to
  return to Algeria. The country was yet far from subdued. The Kabyles, and
  the Arabs in the south, made protracted resistance, and rose again and
  again against the yoke which it was attempted to impose upon them. The
  numerous risings that successively took place thus rendered Algeria a
  school for French generals, such as Pélissier, Canrobert, St. Arnaud, and
  MacMahon. In 1864 MacMahon succeeded Pélissier as governor-general, and
  had as his first work to put down an insurrection. About this time the
  Emperor Napoleon III, who had visited the colony, introduced considerable
  modifications into the government, recognizing that the native races had
  grievances to complain of, and that the French rulers were in various
  ways astray in the methods of government adopted. Fresh disturbances
  broke out in the south nearly every year till 1871, when, owing to the
  Franco-Prussian war, a great effort was made to throw off the French
  yoke, the colony being nearly denuded of French soldiers. It was,
  however, completely suppressed, and in order to remove what was believed
  to be one principal cause of the frequent insurrections, a civil
  government was established instead of the military government in the
  northern parts of the colony. The southern parts, inhabited by nomadic
  tribes, are still subject to military rule. When the French took in hand
  the occupation of Tunis, a rising took place (in 1881) in the west of
  Algeria, under a chieftain who was able to inflict some loss and damage
  on the French forces and colonists, but with no permanent result. Since
  then quietness has generally prevailed in the colony, where the French,
  however, continue to maintain a considerable military force. Owing to
  this and other expenditure Algeria has always formed a burden on the
  resources of France. The great aid rendered by Algeria to France during
  the European War led the French Government to introduce new laws. The law
  of 4th Feb., 1919, gives French citizenship to all Algerian natives under
  certain conditions.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: M.&nbsp;D.

  <p><b>Algiers</b> (al&prime;j&#x113;rz; Fr., <i>Alger</i>), a city and
  seaport on the Mediterranean, capital of the French colony of Algeria, is
  situated on the west side of the Bay of Algiers, partly on the slope of a
  hill facing the sea. The old town, which is the higher, is oriental in
  appearance, with narrow, crooked streets, and houses that are strong,
  prison-like edifices. Its crowning point is the Kasbah, or ancient
  fortress of the Deys, about 500 feet above the sea, now serving as
  barracks. The modern French town, which occupies the lower slope and
  spreads along the shore, is handsomely built, with broad streets and
  elegant squares. It contains the Government buildings, the central
  military and civil establishments, the residence of the governor-general
  and the officials of the general and provincial Government, the superior
  courts of justice, the archbishop's palace and the cathedral, various
  other churches, including an English church and library, the great
  commercial establishments, &amp;c. A fine boulevard built on a series of
  arches, and bordered on one side by handsome buildings, runs along the
  sea-front of the town overlooking the bay, harbour, and shipping. Forty
  feet below are the quay and railway-station, reached by inclined roads
  leading from the centre of the boulevard. The harbour is good and
  capacious, enclosed by piers or jetties, and otherwise improved at great
  expense, and it and the city are defended by a strong series of
  fortifications. Algiers is well provided with educational institutions,
  including high schools or colleges for law, medicine, literature,
  mathematics, and natural science; besides normal schools, an observatory,
  public library, &amp;c. Algiers is in every way far the most important
  place in Algeria. There is a large shipping trade carried on, especially
  with Marseilles, Cette, and some of the Spanish ports. Trade routes from
  the interior and also railways centre in Algiers, and the exports include
  grain, wine, cattle, wool, ore, tobacco, fruit, olive-oil, &amp;c.
  Algiers is now an important coaling station The city possesses
  widely-extended suburbs. The climate, though variable, makes it a very
  desirable winter residence for invalids and others from colder regions.
  Though warm, it is bracing. There is a considerable rainfall (average 29
  inches), but the dry air and absorbent soil prevent it from being
  disagreeable. The winter months resemble a bright, sunny English autumn,
  while the heat of summer is not so intense as that of <!-- Page 106
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>[106]</span>Egypt. The
  sirocco or desert wind is troublesome, however, during summer, but in the
  winter it is merely a pleasant, warm, dry breeze. Hailstorms are not
  infrequent, but frost and snow in Algiers are so rare as to be almost
  unknown. Pop. 172,397.</p>

  <p><b>Alham&prime;bra</b> (Ar. <i>al</i> and <i>hamrah</i>, 'the' and
  'red'), a famous group of buildings in Spain, forming the citadel of
  Granada when that city was one of the principal seats of the empire of
  the Moors in Spain, situated on a height, surrounded by a wall flanked by
  many towers, and having a circuit of 2¼ miles. Within the circuit of the
  walls are two churches, a number of mean houses, and some straggling
  gardens, besides the palace of Charles V and the celebrated Moorish
  palace which is often distinctively spoken of as the Alhambra. This
  building, to which the celebrity of the site is entirely due, was the
  royal palace of the Kings of Granada. The greater part of the present
  building belongs to the first half of the fourteenth century. In the
  course of centuries, both through neglect and acts of vandalism, the
  beauty of the Alhambra has suffered considerably. The work of restoration
  was, however, undertaken in 1824 by the architect José Contreras, and
  continued by his son Rafael from 1847-90. It consists mainly of buildings
  surrounding two oblong courts, the one, called the Court of the Fishpond
  (or of the Myrtles), 138 by 74 feet, lying north and south; the other,
  called the Court of the Lions, from a fountain ornamented with twelve
  lions in marble, 115 by 66 feet, lying east and west, described as being,
  with the apartments that surround it, "the gem of Arabian art in Spain,
  its most beautiful and most perfect example". Its design is elaborate,
  exhibiting a profusion of exquisite detail gorgeous in colouring, but the
  smallness of its size deprives it of the element of majesty. The
  peristyle or portico on each side is supported by 128 pillars of white
  marble, 11 feet high, sometimes placed singly and sometimes in groups.
  Two pavilions project into the court at each end, the domed roof of one
  having been restored. Some of the finest chambers of the Alhambra open
  into this court, and near the entrance a museum of Moorish remains has
  been formed. On the opposite side of the Court of the Lions is the Hall
  of the Abencerrages. The prevalence of stucco or plaster ornamentation is
  one of the features of the Alhambra, which becomes especially remarkable
  in the beautiful honeycomb 'stalactite vaulting'. Arabesques and
  geometrical designs with interwoven inscriptions are present in the
  richest profusion. Cf. Owen <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  of his adherents, born <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 602. He married
  Fatima, the daughter of the prophet, but after the death of Mahomet (632)
  his claims to the caliphate were set aside in favour successively of
  Abu-Bekr, Omar, and Othman. On the assassination of Othman, in <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> 656, he became caliph, and after a series of
  struggles with his opponents, including Ayesha, widow of Mahomet, finally
  lost his life by assassination at Kufa in 661. A Mahommedan schism arose
  after his death, and has produced two sects. One sect, called the
  Shiites, put Ali on a level with Mahomet, and do not acknowledge the
  three caliphs who preceded Ali. They are regarded as heretics by the
  other sect, called Sunnites. The Turks hold his memory in abhorrence,
  whilst the Persians call him the Lion of God, and venerate him as second
  only to the prophet. The <i>Maxims</i> and <i>Hymns</i> of Ali are yet
  extant. See <i>Caliph</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ali,</b> Pasha of Yan&#x12D;na, generally called <i>Ali Pasha</i>,
  a bold and able, but ferocious and unscrupulous Albanian, born in 1741,
  son of an Albanian chief, who was deprived of his territories by
  rapacious neighbours. Ali by his enterprise and success, and by his
  entire want of scruple, got possession of more than his father had lost,
  and made himself master of a large part of Albania, including
  Yan&#x12D;na, which the Porte sanctioned his holding, with the title of
  pasha. Among the travellers who visited his Court at Yan&#x12D;na was
  Byron, who has left a record of his impressions in <i>Childe Harold's
  Pilgrimage</i>. Ali Pasha was an apostle of European culture in the East,
  and the first to feel the necessity for energetic reforms in the old
  Moslem institutions. He displayed excellent qualities, putting an end to
  brigandage and anarchy, making roads, and encouraging commerce. He still
  farther extended his sway by subduing the brave Suliotes of Epirus, whom
  he conquered in 1803, after a three years' war. Aiming at independent
  sovereignty, he intrigued alternately with England, France, and Russia,
  and became almost independent of the Porte, which at length determined,
  in 1820, to pronounce his <!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page108"></a>[108]</span>deposition. Ali resisted several pashas
  who were sent to carry out this decision, only surrendering at last in
  1822, on receiving assurances that his life and property would be granted
  him. Faith was not kept with him, however; he was killed, and his head
  was cut off and conveyed to Constantinople, while his treasures were
  seized by the Porte.</p>

  making himself virtual governor of Egypt. He then refused the customary
  tribute to the Porte, and coined money in his own name. In 1769 he took
  advantage of a war, in which the Porte was then engaged with Russia, to
  endeavour to add Syria and Palestine to his Egyptian dominion, and in
  this he had almost succeeded, when the defection of his own adopted son
  Mohammed Bey drove him from Egypt. Joining his ally Sheikh Daher in
  Syria, he still pursued his plans of conquest with remarkable success,
  till in 1773 he was induced to make the attempt to recover Egypt with
  insufficient means. In a battle near Cairo his army was completely
  defeated and he himself taken prisoner, dying a few days afterwards
  either of his wounds or by poison.</p>

  <p><b>A&prime;lien,</b> in relation to any country, a person born out of
  the jurisdiction of the country, and not having acquired the full rights
  of a citizen of it. The position of aliens depends upon the laws of the
  respective countries, but generally speaking aliens owe a local
  allegiance, and are bound equally with natives to obey all general rules
  for the preservation of order which do not relate specially to citizens.
  Aliens have been often treated with great harshness by the laws of some
  States. Thus in France there long existed what was known as the <i>droit
  d'aubaine</i>, a law which claimed for the benefit of the State the
  effects of deceased foreigners leaving no heirs who were natives. Aliens
  have been repeatedly the objects of legislation in Britain, and the
  tendency at the present day is to communicate some of the rights of
  citizenship to aliens, and to widen the definition of subjects. According
  to the Act of 1870 that now regulates the matter, real and personal
  property of every description may be acquired, held, and disposed of by
  an alien, in the same manner in all respects as by a natural-born British
  subject. No other right or privilege (such as the right to hold any
  office or any municipal, parliamentary, or other franchise) is by this
  Act conferred on an alien except such as are expressly given in respect
  of property. Previously aliens could hold only personal property; they
  were incompetent to hold landed property, except under certain conditions
  of residence or <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page109"></a>[109]</span>business occupancy for a term of years not
  exceeding twenty-one. The children of aliens born in Britain are
  natural-born subjects. Formerly the only mode of naturalization was by
  Act of Parliament; but now an alien who has resided in the United Kingdom
  for not less than one year immediately preceding his application, and has
  previously resided in any part of His Majesty's dominions for four years
  during the last eight years before the application, or who has been in
  the service of the Crown for not less than five years, and intends to
  reside in the kingdom, or to serve the British Crown, may apply to the
  Secretary of State for a certificate of naturalization, and on giving
  evidence of particulars may obtain it, being thereby entitled to almost
  all the political and other rights of a natural-born British subject. At
  present the law is laid down in the British Nationality and Status of
  Aliens Act, 1914 and 1918. It used to be a principle in English law, that
  a natural-born subject could not divest himself of his allegiance by
  becoming naturalized in a foreign State (<i>nemo potest exuere
  patriam</i>); but it is now laid down that a British subject who has
  voluntarily become naturalized in a foreign State thereby ceases to be a
  British subject. Any British subject who has become an alien may apply
  for a certificate of readmission to British nationality on the same terms
  as those provided for aliens in general. In the United States the
  position of aliens as regards acquisition and holding of real property
  differs somewhat in the different States, though in recent times the
  disabilities of aliens have been removed in most of them. Personal
  property they can take, hold, and dispose of like native citizens.
  Individual States have no jurisdiction on the subject of naturalization,
  though they may pass laws admitting aliens to any privilege short of
  citizenship. A naturalized citizen is not eligible for election as
  president or vice-president of the United States, and cannot serve as
  senator until after nine years' citizenship, nor as a member of the House
  of Representatives until after seven years' citizenship. Five years'
  residence in the United States and one year's permanent residence in the
  particular State are necessary for the attainment of citizenship.</p>

  <p><b>Alien Immigration.</b> In various countries certain classes of
  aliens have long been prohibited from gaining admission. In the United
  States, for instance, admission is refused to such persons as idiots,
  epileptics, persons suffering from loathsome or dangerous contagious
  diseases, paupers, criminals (except political criminals), illiterate
  persons, &amp;c. Chinese labourers as a whole are excluded, and even any
  persons coming to America under a definite agreement to engage in any
  kind of labour or service. Similar laws are in force in Australia, where
  there is a test that a person proposing to settle in the country must be
  able to write fifty words of a European language. Towards the end of last
  century the great influx of foreigners into Britain, and into London in
  particular, drew public attention to the matter. A select committee
  appointed in 1888 reported in favour of the exclusion of destitute
  aliens, in 1894 a bill was introduced into the House of Lords, while in
  1898 a bill to regulate the immigration of aliens was passed in the
  Lords, but made no further progress. In 1902 a royal commission was
  appointed, and drew up a report, published in 1903, containing valuable
  information and various recommendations. Among these were the
  establishment of an immigration department, and the granting of powers to
  deport criminals, prostitutes, and other undesirable aliens, and to
  prevent the landing of persons mentally unfit or suffering from
  infectious or loathsome diseases. In 1904 an Aliens Immigration Bill was
  introduced and read a second time in the House of Commons. It was based
  on the recommendations of the commission, and in its favour it was argued
  that a large amount of British labour had been displaced by aliens, in
  London especially, that the prevalence of crime among aliens was out of
  proportion to their numbers, that many of them were paupers, criminals
  convicted in their own country, or other undesirables. In 1905 another
  bill on the subject was introduced by the Government, which succeeded in
  passing it, so that the matter can now be dealt with, and undesirable
  aliens kept out. Since the European War (1914-8) and the new passport
  regulations it is easy to ascertain the number of aliens that enter the
  country and settle. At the census of 1901 the whole alien population was
  set down at 286,925, as against 219,523 in 1891, but there has been a
  very large influx from 1901 to 1914, by far the largest number consisting
  of Russian and Polish Jews. The restrictions imposed upon aliens during
  the European War are still in force, so far as they prohibit landing by
  any alien, except at specified ports by leave of an immigration officer,
  and, in case of former enemy aliens, by special permission of the Home
  Secretary. Cf. J.&nbsp;M. Landa, <i>The Alien Problem</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Align&prime;ment</b> (a-l&#x12B;n&prime;ment), a military term,
  signifying the act of adjusting to a straight line or in regular straight
  lines, or the state of being so adjusted.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;iment,</b> food, a term which includes everything, solid
  or liquid, serving as nutriment for the bodily system. Aliments are of
  the most diverse character, but all of them must contain nutritious
  matter of some kind, which, being extracted by the act of digestion,
  enters the blood, and effects by assimilation the repair of the body.
  Alimentary matter, therefore, must be similar to animal substance, or
  transmutable into such. All alimentary substances must, therefore, be
  composed in a greater or less degree of soluble parts, which easily lose
  their peculiar qualities in the process of digestion, and correspond to
  the elements of the body. The food of animals consists for the most part
  of substances containing little oxygen and exhibiting a high degree of
  chemical combination, in which respects they differ from most substances
  that serve as sustenance for plants, which are generally highly oxidized
  and exhibit little chemical combination. According to the nature of their
  constituents most of the aliments of animals are divided into nitrogenous
  (consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen along with nitrogen, and also
  of sulphur and phosphorus) and non-nitrogenous (consisting of carbon,
  hydrogen, and oxygen without nitrogen). Water and salts are usually
  considered as forming a third group, and, in the widest sense of the word
  aliment, oxygen alone, which enters the blood in the lungs, forms the
  fourth. The articles used as food by man do not consist entirely of
  nutritious substances, but with few exceptions are compounds of various
  nutritious with indigestible and accordingly innutritious substances. The
  only nitrogenous aliments are albuminous substances, and these are
  contained largely in animal food (flesh, eggs, milk, cheese). The
  principal non-nitrogenous substance obtained as food from animals is fat.
  Sugar is so obtained in smaller quantities (in milk). While some
  vegetable substances also contain much albumen, very many of them are
  rich in starch. Among vegetable substances the richest in albumen are the
  legumes (peas, beans, and lentils), and following them come the cereals
  (wheat, oats, &amp;c.). Sugar, water, and salts may pass without any
  change into the circulatory system; but albuminous substances cannot do
  so without being first rendered soluble and capable of absorption (in the
  stomach and intestines); starch must be converted into sugar and fat
  emulsified (chiefly by the action of the pancreatic juice). One of the
  objects of cooking is to make our food more susceptible of the operation
  of the digestive fluids.</p>

  <p>The relative importance of the various nutritious substances that are
  taken into the system and enter the blood depends upon their chemical
  constitution. The albuminous substances are the most indispensable,
  inasmuch as they form the material by which the constant waste of the
  body is repaired, whence they are called by Liebig the substance-formers.
  But a part of the operation of albuminous nutriments may be performed
  equally well, and at less cost, by non-nitrogenous substances, that part
  being the maintenance of the temperature of the body. As is well known,
  the temperature of warm-blooded animals is considerably higher than the
  ordinary temperature of the surrounding air, in man about 98° F., and the
  uniformity of this temperature is maintained by the heat which is set
  free by the chemical processes (of oxidation) which go on within the
  body. Now these processes take place as well with non-nitrogenous as with
  nitrogenous substances. The former are even preferable to the latter for
  the keeping up of these processes; by oxidation they yield larger
  quantities of heat with less labour to the body, and they are hence
  called the heat-givers. The best heat-giver is fat. Albuminous matters
  are not only the tissue-formers of the body; they also supply the vehicle
  for the oxygen, inasmuch as it is of such matters that the blood
  corpuscles are formed. The more red blood corpuscles an animal possesses,
  the more oxygen can it take into its system, and the more easily and
  rapidly can it carry on the process of oxidation and develop heat. Now
  only a part of the heat so developed passes away into the environment of
  the animal; another part is transformed within the body (in the muscles)
  into mechanical work. Hence it follows that the non-nitrogenous articles
  of food produce not merely heat but also work, but only with the
  assistance of albuminous matters, which, on the one hand, compose the
  working machine, and, on the other hand, convey the oxygen necessary for
  oxidation.</p>

  <p>The wholesome or unwholesome character of any aliment depends, in a
  great measure, on the state of the digestive organs in any given case, as
  also on the method in which it is cooked. Very often a simple aliment is
  made indigestible by artificial cookery. In any given case the digestive
  power of the individual is to be considered in order to determine whether
  a particular aliment is wholesome or not. In general, therefore, we can
  only say that that aliment is healthy <!-- Page 111 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>[111]</span>which is easily
  soluble, and is suited to the power of digestion of the individual. Man
  is fitted to derive nourishment both from animal and vegetable aliment,
  but can live exclusively on either. The nations of the North incline
  generally more to animal aliments; those of the South, and the Orientals,
  more to vegetable. The inhabitants of the most northerly regions live
  almost entirely upon animal food, and very largely on fat on account of
  its heat-giving property. See <i>Dietetics</i>, <i>Digestion</i>,
  <i>Adulteration</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Alimentary Canal,</b> a common name given to the &oelig;sophagus,
  stomach, and intestines of animals. See <i>&OElig;sophagus</i>,
  <i>Intestine</i>, <i>Stomach</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Ali-Mirza,</b> Shah of Persia, son of Muzaffar-ed-Din, born in
  1872. He succeeded his father on 8th Jan., 1907. Although his European
  education had given him sympathies for Western civilization, he showed
  himself despotic, and became very unpopular. He was deposed by the
  National Assembly or Mejliss in July, 1909, and his son proclaimed Shah
  in his place.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;imony</b> (Lat. <i>alere</i>, to nourish), in law, the
  allowance to which a woman is entitled while a matrimonial suit is
  pending between her and her husband, or after a legal separation from her
  husband, not occasioned by adultery or elopement on her part. It is
  either temporary or permanent, the former being the provision made by the
  husband pending the suit, the latter after the decree.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;iquot Part</b> is such part of a number as will divide and
  measure it exactly without any remainder. For instance, 2 is an aliquot
  part of 4, 3 of 12, and 4 of 20.</p>

  <p><b>Alisma&prime;ceæ,</b> the water-plantain family, a natural order of
  endogenous plants, the members of which are herbaceous, annual or
  perennial; with petiolate leaves sheathing at the base, hermaphrodite
  (rarely unisexual) flowers, disposed in spikes, panicles, or racemes.
  They are floating or marsh plants, and many have edible fleshy rhizomes.
  They are found in all countries, but especially in Europe and North
  America, where their rather brilliant flowers adorn the pools and
  streams. The principal genera are <i>Alisma</i> (water-plantain)
  <i>Sagittaria</i> (arrow-head), <i>Damasonium</i> (star-fruit), and
  <i>Butomus</i> (flowering-rush).</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;ison,</b> Rev. Archibald, a theologian and writer on
  æsthetics, born at Edinburgh in 1757; died there in 1839. He studied at
  Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford, entered the English Church, and
  finally (1800) settled as the minister of an Episcopal chapel at
  Edinburgh. He published 2 volumes of sermons, and a work entitled
  <i>Essays on the Nature and Principles of Taste</i> (1790), in which he
  maintains that all the beauty of material objects depends upon the
  associations connected with them.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;ison,</b> Sir Archibald, lawyer and writer of history, son
  of the above, was born in Shropshire in 1792, and died in 1867, near
  Glasgow. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, and in 1814 was
  admitted to the Scottish bar. He spent the next eight years in
  Continental travel. On his return he was appointed advocate depute, which
  post he held till 1830. In 1832 he published <i>Principles of the
  Criminal Law of Scotland</i>, and in 1833 <i>The Practice of the Criminal
  Law</i>. He was appointed sheriff of Lanarkshire in 1834, and retained
  this post till his death. He was made a baronet in 1852. His chief
  work&mdash;<i>The History of Europe, from 1789 to 1815</i>&mdash;was
  first issued in 10 vols., 1833-42, the narrative being subsequently
  brought down to 1852, the beginning of the second French Empire. This
  work displays industry and research, and is generally accurate, but not
  very readable. It has been translated into French, German, Arabic,
  Hindustani, &amp;c. Among Sir Archibald's other productions are
  <i>Principles of Population</i>; <i>Free-trade and Protection</i>;
  <i>England in 1815 and 1845</i>; <i>Life of the Duke of Marlborough</i>,
  &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;ison,</b> General Sir Archibald, <span
  class="scac">G.C.B.</span>, son of the above, was born 1826, entered the
  army in 1846, and served in the Crimea, in India during the mutiny, and
  in the Ashantee expedition of 1873-4. In Egypt, in 1882, he led the
  Highland Brigade at the battle of Tel-el-Kebir, and in 1882-3 remained in
  command of the army of occupation (of 12,000 men). He retired from the
  army in 1893, and died in 1907.</p>

  <p><b>Aliwal&prime;,</b> a village of Hindustan in the Punjab, on the
  left bank of the Sutlej, celebrated from the battle fought in its
  vicinity, 28th Jan., 1846, between the Sikhs and a British army commanded
  by Sir Harry Smith, resulting in the total defeat of the Sikhs.</p>

  <p><b>Aliwal North,</b> a town in the eastern part of Cape Province, on
  the Orange River, which here forms the boundary with the Orange Free
  State, and is crossed by a fine bridge&mdash;the Frere Bridge. It stands
  at the height of 4350 feet, in a locality said to be highly suitable for
  consumptives, and the warm sulphur springs in the neighbourhood also
  attract many invalids. It is a well-built place, with churches, hotels,
  golf links, race-course, &amp;c.; and has railway connection with East
  London, Port Elizabeth, &amp;c. Pop. 5557.&mdash;<i>Aliwal South</i> was
  a name formerly given to Mossel Bay, the small seaport midway between
  Cape Town and Port Elizabeth.</p>

  <p><b>Aliz&prime;arine,</b> a substance contained in the madder root
  (<i>Rubia tinctorum</i>), and largely used in dyeing reds of various
  shades, as Turkey red, &amp;c. Until 1868 it was obtained entirely from
  madder root, but the use of the root has been almost superseded by the
  employment of alizarine itself, prepared artificially from one of the
  <!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page112"></a>[112]</span>constituents of coal-tar. It forms
  yellowish-red prismatic crystals, nearly insoluble in cold, but dissolved
  to a small extent by boiling water, and readily soluble in alcohol and
  ether. It possesses exceedingly strong tinctorial powers.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;kahest,</b> the so-called universal solvent or menstruum
  of the alchemists. The word is believed to have been invented by
  Paracelsus.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;kali</b> (from Ar. <i>al-qali</i>, the ashes of the plant
  from which soda was first obtained, or the plant itself), a term first
  used to designate the soluble parts of the ashes of plants, especially of
  seaweed, and designated <i>fixed alkali</i>, as marking a distinction
  from ammonia, which was termed <i>volatile alkali</i>. Now the term is
  applied to various classes of bodies having the following properties in
  common: (1) solubility in water; (2) the power of neutralizing acids, and
  forming salts with them; (3) the property of corroding animal and
  vegetable substances; (4) the property of altering the tint of many
  colouring matters&mdash;thus, they turn litmus, reddened by an acid, into
  blue; turmeric, brown; and syrup of violets and infusion of red cabbages,
  green. The alkalies may be regarded as water in which part of the
  hydrogen is replaced by a metallic radicle. The caustic alkalies are
  strong alkalies which have a powerful corrosive action on the skin, and
  the common ones are potassic hydroxide or caustic potash, sodic hydroxide
  or caustic soda, and lithic hydroxide. <i>Volatile Alkali</i>, or ammonic
  hydroxide, is a much feebler alkali than the others, and when the
  solution is heated all the ammonia is driven off. Other alkalies are
  calcic hydroxide or slaked lime, a solution of which in water is known as
  <i>lime-water</i>; baric hydroxide and strontic hydroxide, derived from
  the metals barium and strontium. Quicklime is the only alkali extensively
  used in agriculture.</p>

  <p><b>Alkalim&prime;eter,</b> an instrument for ascertaining the quantity
  of free alkali in any impure specimen, as in the potashes of commerce.
  These, besides the carbonate of potash, of which they principally
  consist, usually contain a portion of foreign salts, as sulphate and
  chloride of potassium, and as the true worth of the substance, or price
  for which it ought to sell, depends entirely on the quantity of
  carbonate, it is of importance to be able to measure it accurately by
  some easy process. This process depends on the neutralization of the
  alkali by an acid of known strength, the point of neutralization being
  determined by the fact that neutral liquids are without action on either
  red or blue litmus solution. The alkalimeter is merely a graduated
  tube&mdash;a burette&mdash;with a stopcock at the lower extremity, from
  which the standard acid is dropped into water in which a known weight of
  the substance is dissolved. The quantity required to produce
  neutralization being noted, the strength of the liquid tested is easily
  arrived at. A process of neutralization, exactly the same in principle,
  may be employed to test the strength of acids by alkalies, the one
  process being called <i>alkalimetry</i> the other <i>acidimetry</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;kaloid,</b> a term applied to a class of nitrogenous
  compounds having basic properties, found in living plants, usually in
  combination with organic acids. They are usually given names ending in
  <i>-ine</i>, as <i>morphine</i>, <i>quinine</i>, <i>aconitine</i>,
  <i>nicotine</i>, <i>caffeine</i>, &amp;c. Most alkaloids occur in plants,
  but some are formed by decomposition. Most natural alkaloids contain
  carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen, but a few contain no oxygen. The
  nitrogen they contain imparts to them basic properties&mdash;they are
  organic bases&mdash;and hence they all form salts with acids. They all
  possess a pronounced bitter taste, and the poisonous nature of many
  plants, e.g. hemlock, yew, deadly nightshade, &amp;c., are due to the
  alkaloids they contain. Although formed originally within the plant, it
  has been found possible to prepare several of these alkaloids by
  artificial means.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;kanet,</b> a dyeing drug, the bark of the root of the
  <i>Anch&#x16B;sa</i> or <i>Alkanna tinctoria</i>, a plant of the order
  Boraginaceæ, with downy and spear-shaped leaves, and clusters of small
  purple or reddish flowers. The plant is sometimes cultivated in Britain,
  chiefly on the east coast of England, but most of the alkanet of commerce
  is imported from the Levant or from southern France. It imparts a fine
  deep-red colour to all unctuous substances and is used for colouring
  oils, plasters, lip-salve, confections, &amp;c.; also in compositions for
  rubbing and giving colour to mahogany furniture, and to colour spurious
  port-wine.</p>

  <p><b>Alkan&prime;na,</b> a name of henna. See also <i>Alkanet</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Alkar&prime;sin,</b> an extremely poisonous liquid containing
  kakodyle, together with oxidation products of this substance, and
  formerly known as <i>Cadet's fuming liquor</i>, characterized by its
  insupportable smell and high degree of spontaneous combustibility when
  exposed to air.</p>

  <p><b>Al-katif,</b> a town of Arabia, on the Persian Gulf, carrying on a
  considerable trade. Pop. 6000.</p>

  <p><b>Alkmaar</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>lk&prime;mär), a town of the Netherlands,
  province of North Holland, on the North Holland Canal, and 20 miles <span
  class="scac">N.N.W.</span> of Amsterdam; regularly built, with a fine
  church (St. Lawrence) and a richly decorated Gothic town-house;
  manufactures of salt, sail-cloth, vinegar, leather, &amp;c., and an
  extensive trade in cattle, corn, butter, and cheese. Pop. 22,685.</p>

  <p><b>Al-Ko&prime;ran,</b> or <b>Qu&#x201B;ran</b>. See <i>Koran</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Alla breve</b> (br&#x101;&prime;v&#x101;), a musical direction
  expressing that a breve is to be played as fast as a semibreve, a
  semibreve as fast as a minim, and <!-- Page 113 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>[113]</span>so on. It is also
  called a capella, as it is employed in church music.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;lah,</b> in Arabic, the name of God, a word of kindred
  origin with the Hebrew word <i>Elohim</i>. <i>Alla Akbar</i> (God is
  great) is a Mahommedan war-cry.</p>

  <p><b>Allahab&#x101;d&prime;</b> ('city of Allah'), an ancient city of
  India, capital of the United Provinces, on the wedge of land formed by
  the Jumna and the Ganges, largely built of mud houses, though the English
  quarter has more of a European aspect. Among the remarkable buildings are
  the fort, occupying the angle between the rivers, and containing the
  remains of an ancient palace, and now also the barracks, &amp;c.; the
  mausoleum and garden of Khosru, the tomb being a handsome domed building;
  the Government offices and courts; Government house; the Roman Catholic
  cathedral; the Central College for the United Provinces; the Mayo
  Memorial and town hall. Allahabad is one of the chief resorts of Hindu
  pilgrims, who have their sins washed away by bathing in the waters of the
  sacred rivers Ganges and Jumna at their junction; and is also the scene
  of a great fair in December and January. There are no manufactures of
  importance, but a large general and transit trade is carried on. The town
  is as old as the third century <span class="scac">B.C.</span> In the
  mutiny of 1857 it was the scene of a serious outbreak and massacre. Pop.
  171,697.&mdash;The division of <i>Allahabad</i> contains the districts of
  Cawnpur, Futtehpur, Hamirpur, Banda, Jaunpur, and Allahabad; area, 17,265
  sq. miles. Pop. 5,535,803.&mdash;The district contains an area of 2852
  sq. miles, about five-sixths being under cultivation. Pop. 1,487,904.</p>

  <p><b>Allaman&prime;da,</b> a genus of American tropical plants, ord.
  Apocynaceæ, with large yellow or violet flowers; some of them are grown
  in European greenhouses. <i>A. cathartica</i> has strong emetic and
  purgative properties.</p>

  <p><b>Allan,</b> David, a Scottish painter, born 1744, died 1796. He
  studied in Foulis's academy of painting and engraving in Glasgow, and for
  sixteen years in Italy; finally establishing himself at Edinburgh, where
  he succeeded Runciman as master of the Trustees' Academy. His
  illustrations of the <i>Gentle Shepherd</i>, <i>The Cotter's Saturday
  Night</i>, and other sketches of rustic life and manners in Scotland are
  his best-known works.</p>

  <p><b>Allan,</b> Sir William, a distinguished Scottish artist, born in
  1782, died in 1850. He was a fellow student with Wilkie in Edinburgh,
  afterwards a student of the Royal Academy, London. After residing in
  Russia for ten years, he returned to Scotland, and publicly exhibited his
  pictures, one of which (<i>Circassian Captives</i>) made his reputation.
  He now turned his attention to historical painting, and produced <i>Knox
  admonishing Mary Queen of Scots</i>, <i>Murder of Rizzio</i>, <i>Exiles
  on their way to Siberia</i>, <i>The Slave Market at Constantinople</i>,
  &amp;c.; and afterwards also battle scenes, as the <i>Battle of
  Prestonpans</i>, <i>Nelson boarding the San Nicolas</i>, and two pictures
  of <i>The Battle of Waterloo</i>, the one from the British, the other
  from the French position, and delineating the actual scene and the
  incidents therein taking place at the moment chosen for the
  representation. One of these Waterloo pictures was purchased by the Duke
  of Wellington. He travelled extensively, visiting Italy, Greece, Asia
  Minor, Spain, and Barbary. In 1835 he became a Royal Academician, in 1838
  president of the Scottish Academy, and in 1842 he was knighted.</p>

  <p><b>Allan&prime;tois,</b> a structure appearing during the early
  development of vertebrate animals&mdash;Reptiles, Birds, and Mammalia. It
  is largely made up of blood-vessels, and, especially in Birds, attains a
  large size. It forms the inner lining to the shell, and may thus be
  viewed as the surface by means of which the respiration of the embryo is
  carried on. In Mammalia the allantois is not so largely developed as in
  Birds, and it enters largely into the formation of the placenta.</p>

  <p><b>Alleghany</b> (al-le-g&#x101;&prime;ni), a river of Pennsylvania
  and New York, which unites with the Monongahela at Pittsburg to form the
  Ohio; navigable nearly 200 miles above Pittsburg.</p>

  <p><b>Alleghany Mountains,</b> or the <b>Alleghanies,</b> a name
  sometimes used as synonymous with Appalachians, but also often restricted
  to the portion of those mountains that traverses the states of Virginia,
  Maryland, and Pennsylvania from south-west to north-east, and consists of
  a series of parallel ridges for the most part wooded to the summit, and
  with some fertile valleys between. Their mean elevation is about 2500
  feet; but in Virginia they rise to 4473.</p>

  <p><b>Allegheny</b> (al-le-gen&prime;i), a city of the United States, in
  Pennsylvania, on the River Allegheny, opposite Pittsburg, of which it may
  be considered virtually to be a suburb, and with which it is connected by
  six bridges. The principal industries are connected with iron and
  machinery. Pop. 132,283. Also called Allegheny City.</p>

  <p><b>Alle&prime;giance</b> (from mid-Eng. <i>ligeaunce</i>, formed from
  <i>liege</i>), according to Blackstone, is "the tie or <i>ligamen</i>
  which binds the subject to the sovereign in return for that protection
  which the sovereign affords the subject", or, generally, the obedience
  which every subject or citizen owes to the Government of his country. It
  used to be the doctrine of the English law that natural-born subjects owe
  an allegiance which is intrinsic and perpetual, and which cannot be
  divested by any act of their own (<i>Nemo potest exuere patriam</i>); but
  this is no longer the case since the Naturalization Act passed in 1870, A
  British subject, however, or <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page114"></a>[114]</span>a child who has acquired a British
  domicile by the naturalization of an alien parent, cannot in time of war
  divest himself of British nationality for the purpose of becoming an
  enemy alien. Aliens owe a temporary or local allegiance to the Government
  under which they for the time reside. Usurpers in undisturbed possession
  of the Crown are entitled to allegiance; and thus treasons against Henry
  VI were punished in the reign of Edward IV, though the former had, by Act
  of Parliament, been declared a usurper.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;legory,</b> a figurative representation in which the signs
  (words or forms) signify something besides their literal or direct
  meaning. In rhetoric, allegory is often but a continued simile. Parables
  and fables are a species of allegory. Sometimes long works are throughout
  allegorical, as Spenser's <i>Faerie Queene</i> and Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's
  Progress</i>. When an allegory is thus continued it is indispensable to
  its success that not only the allegorical meaning should be appropriate,
  but that the story should have an interest of its own in the direct
  meaning apart from the allegorical significance. Allegories are frequent
  in the Old Testament, whilst in the New they take the form of parables.
  One of the best-known allegories in classical literature is the story of
  the stomach and the members of the body in the speech attributed to
  Menenius Agrippa by Plutarch and Livy. (Cf. Shakespeare,
  <i>Coriolanus</i>, i, 1.) Allegory is often made use of in painting and
  sculpture as well as in literature.</p>

  <p><b>Allegri</b> (a<span class="x1"><span

  Italian composer, born at Rome in 1560 or 1585, died there about 1650;
  celebrated for his <i>Miserere</i>, a setting of the fifty-first psalm
  (the fiftieth in the <i>Vulgate</i>), which in the Latin version begins
  with that word. Allegri's <i>Miserere</i> is annually performed in the
  Sistine Chapel at Rome.</p>

  <p><b>Allegro</b> (It., a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>l-l&#x101;&prime;gr&#x14D;), a musical
  term expressing a more or less quick rate of movement, or a piece of
  music or movement in lively time. <i>Allegro moderato</i>, moderately
  quick; <i>allegro maestoso</i>, quick but with dignity; <i>allegro
  assai</i> and <i>allegro molto</i>, very quick; <i>allegro con brio</i>
  or <i>con fuoco</i>, with fire and energy; <i>allegrissimo</i>, with the
  utmost rapidity.</p>

  <p><b>Allein</b> (al&prime;en), Joseph, English Nonconformist divine;
  born 1633, died 1668; the author of a popular religious book entitled,
  <i>An Alarm to Unconverted Sinners, or The Sure Guide to Heaven</i>
  (1672).</p>

  <p><b>Allein</b> (al&prime;en), Richard, English Nonconformist divine;
  born in 1611, died 1681; rector for twenty years of Batcombe (Somerset);
  deprived of his living at the Restoration, and imprisoned for preaching.
  He wrote, among other things, <i>Vindiciæ Pietatis</i> ('A Vindication of
  Godliness'), published in 1660, which was condemned to be burned in the
  royal kitchen.</p>

  invented in France in the time of Louis XIV, and again in vogue in the
  time of the First Empire. The name is also given to pieces of music based
  on the dance movement. Bach and Handel have composed a great number of
  Allemandes, and Beethoven has written twelve for orchestra.</p>

  <p><b>Allen,</b> Bog of, the name applied to a series of bogs in Ireland
  (not to one continuous morass), dispersed, often widely apart, with
  extensive tracts of dry cultivated soil between, over a broad belt of
  land stretching across the centre of the country, the bogs being,
  however, all on the east side of the Shannon.</p>

  <p><b>Allen,</b> Ethan, an American revolutionary partisan and general;
  born 1737, died 1789. He surprised and captured Ticonderoga Fort (1775);
  attacked Montreal, and was captured and sent to England, being exchanged
  in 1778; wrote against Christianity, <i>Reason, the only Oracle of
  Man</i> (1784).&mdash;His younger brother, Ira (1751-1814), was also
  prominent in the revolutionary era.</p>

  <p><b>Allen,</b> Grant, writer on scientific subjects and novelist, was
  born at Kingston, Canada, 1848, died in 1899. His earlier education he
  received in America, but he also studied in France and graduated at
  Oxford with honours in 1870. From 1873 to 1879 he was connected with
  Queen's College, Jamaica, but afterwards resided chiefly in England, and
  became well known as an exponent of evolutionary science, and as a
  novelist. His first important work, <i>Physiological Æsthetics</i>,
  appeared in 1877; his other scientific or semi-scientific works include
  <i>The Colour Sense</i>; <i>The Evolutionist at Large</i>; <i>Colin
  Clouts Calendar (the record of a summer)</i>; <i>Vignettes from
  Nature</i>; <i>The Colours of Flowers</i>; <i>Flowers and their
  Pedigrees</i>; and <i>Force and Energy, a Theory of Dynamics</i>. Other
  works by him are: <i>Anglo-Saxon Britain</i>; <i>Charles Darwin</i>; and
  <i>The Evolution of the Idea of God</i>. His novels, about thirty in
  number, include: <i>The Devil's Die</i>; <i>The Woman Who Did</i>,

  <p><b>Allen,</b> John, a Scottish political and historical writer; born
  in 1771, died in 1843. He studied medicine, and became M.D. of Edinburgh
  University. In 1801 he went abroad with Lord Holland and family, and
  henceforth he maintained this connection, being long an inmate of Holland
  House (London) and a member of the brilliant society that assembled
  there. He contributed many articles to the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>; and
  wrote <i>An Inquiry into the Rise and Growth of the Royal Prerogative in
  England</i>; <i>Vindication of the Ancient Independence of Scotland</i>;

  died in 1764. He lived mostly at Bath, where he made a large income as
  farmer of a system of posts and as owner of quarries. He is the prototype
  of Squire Allworthy in Fielding's <i>Tom Jones</i>; and after the
  novelist's death he took charge of his family. Pope, who received many
  kindnesses at his hands, referred to him in the lines:</p>

  <p>With Pitt he was on intimate terms, and left him £1000 in his will.
  Hurd, Sherlock, and Warburton were also his friends.</p>

  <p><b>Allen,</b> Thomas, an English mathematician, philosopher,
  antiquarian, and astrologer, born in 1542, died in 1632. He studied at
  Oxford, and lived the greater part of his life in learned retirement,
  corresponding with many of the famous men of his time. In his own day he
  was generally reputed a dealer in the black art.</p>

  <p><b>Allen,</b> William, cardinal, an English Roman Catholic of the time
  of Queen Elizabeth. Influenced by the Jesuit Robert Parsons, he became a
  strenuous opponent of Protestantism and supporter of the claims of Philip
  II to the English throne; born 1532, died 1594. It was by his efforts
  that the English college for Catholics at Douai was established. He was
  made cardinal in 1587. His numerous writings include: <i>The Declaration
  of the Sentence of Sixtus V</i>, and <i>An Admonition to the Nobility and

  <p><b>Allenby, Viscount,</b> Edmund Henry Hynman, British soldier, born
  on 23rd April, 1861, and educated at Haileybury. He joined the
  Inniskilling Dragoons, and in 1884 served with that regiment in the
  Bechuanaland Expedition. He was with the British forces in Zululand in
  1888, took part in the South African war, and commanded the 4th Cavalry
  Brigade, 1905-10. In the European War he at first commanded the British
  Third Army, contributing largely to the victories of the Somme and the
  Aisne. After a reverse, south of Gaza, suffered on 26th March, 1917, by
  the British troops under the command of Sir Archibald Murray, the latter
  was relieved, and General Allenby was placed in command of the
  operations. He made thorough preparations for the next offensive, and his
  progress was very rapid. Beersheba and Gaza were captured, and on 9th
  Dec., 1917 Jerusalem, the Holy City, was surrendered to the general by
  the mayor. His formal entry took place on the 11th. He was awarded the
  <span class="scac">G.C.M.G.</span> on 16th Dec., 1917, and is a Grand
  Officer of the Legion of Honour. In Aug., 1919, he was voted a sum of
  £50,000 and created a viscount, adopting the title of Viscount Allenby of
  Megiddo and of Felixstowe in Suffolk. In Oct., 1919, he was appointed
  High Commissioner for Egypt.</p>

  <p><b>All-fours,</b> a game at cards, which derives its name from the
  four chances of which it consists, for each of which a point is scored.
  These chances are <i>high</i>, or the ace of trumps, or next best trump
  out; <i>low</i>, or the deuce of trumps, or next lowest trump out;
  <i>jack</i>, or the knave of trumps; <i>game</i>, the majority of pips
  collected from the tricks taken by the respective players. The player who
  has all these is said to have <i>all-fours</i>. It is played by two or
  four persons with the full pack. The ace counts four, the king three,
  queen two, knave one, ten ten. The game is known in America as
  <i>Seven-up</i>, <i>Old-sledge</i>, or <i>High-low Jack</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Allia&prime;ceous Plants,</b> plants belonging to the genus Allium
  (ord. Liliaceæ), that to which the onion, leek, garlic, shallot, &amp;c.,
  belong, or to other allied genera, and distinguished by a certain
  peculiar pungent smell and taste characterized as <i>alliaceous</i>. This
  flavour is also found in a few plants having no botanical affinities with
  the above, as in the <i>Alliaria officin&#x101;lis</i>, or
  Jack-by-the-hedge, a plant of the order Cruciferæ.</p>

  <p><b>Alli&prime;ance,</b> a league between two or more Powers. Alliances
  are divided into offensive and defensive. The former are for the purpose
  of attacking a common enemy, and the latter for mutual defence. An
  alliance often unites both of these conditions. Offensive alliances, of
  course, are usually directed against some particular enemy; defensive
  alliances against anyone from <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page116"></a>[116]</span>whom an attack may come. Among the more
  famous alliances in history are: The Triple Alliance of 1688 between
  Great Britain, Sweden, and the Netherlands; The Grand Alliance of 1689
  between the Emperor, Holland, England, Spain, and Saxony; The Quadruple
  Alliance of 1814 between Great Britain, Austria, Russia, and Prussia; The
  Triple Alliance of 1882 between Germany, Austria, and Italy; and The Dual
  Alliance between Russia and France.</p>

  <p><b>Alliance Israélite Universelle,</b> an association founded in Paris
  in 1860 for the protection of the Jews all over the world, but
  particularly with a view to advocating by various means the emancipation
  of the Jews in those countries where they did not enjoy equal civil and
  political rights with the other inhabitants. It was established by six
  Jews of Paris: Aristide Astruc, Isidore Cahen, Jules Carvallo, Narcisse
  Leven, Eugène Manuel, and Charles Netter. Adolphe Crémieux and Salomon
  Munk were among the first presidents of the association. It is managed by
  a central committee resident in Paris, and consisting of 62 members, 23
  of whom live in Paris. The Alliance has done a great deal towards raising
  the status of the Jews in the East by establishing educational
  institutions and industrial and agricultural schools, especially in
  Turkey, Egypt, Morocco, Persia, Bulgaria, Tunis, and Abyssinia. The chief
  sources of its income are the subscriptions and donations of the members.
  Its annual income amounts to about 200,000 francs. It also manages a fund
  of about £400,000 founded by Baron and Baroness de Hirsch for the
  establishment of Jewish Schools in Turkey. The Alliance Israélite works
  in unison with the Anglo-Jewish Association and the Board of Deputies in
  London, two organizations pursuing the same aims.</p>

  <p><b>Alliga&prime;tor</b> (a corruption of Sp. <i>el lagarto</i>, lit.
  the lizard&mdash;Lat. <i>lacertus</i>), a genus of reptiles of the family
  Crocodilidæ, differing from the true crocodiles in having a shorter and
  flatter head, in having cavities or pits in the upper jaw, into which the
  long canine teeth of the under jaw fit, and in having the feet much less
  webbed. Their habits are less perfectly aquatic. They are confined to the
  warmer parts of America, where they frequent swamps and marshes, and may
  be seen basking on the dry ground during the day in the heat of the sun.
  They are most active during the night, when they make a loud bellowing.
  The largest of these animals grow to the length of 18 or 20 feet. They
  are covered by a dense armour of horny scales, impenetrable to a bullet,
  and have a large mouth, armed with strong, conical teeth. They swim with
  wonderful celerity, impelled by their long, laterally-compressed, and
  powerful tails. On land their motions are proportionally slow and
  embarrassed because of the length and unwieldiness of their bodies and
  the shortness of their limbs. They live on fish, and any small animals or
  carrion, and sometimes catch pigs on the shore, or dogs which are
  swimming. They even sometimes make man their prey. In winter they burrow
  in the mud of swamps and marshes, lying torpid till the warm weather. The
  female lays a great number of eggs, which are deposited in the sand or
  mud, and left to be hatched by the heat of the sun, but after this has
  taken place the mother alligator is very attentive to her young. The most
  fierce and dangerous species is that found in the southern parts of the
  United States (<i>Alligator Lucius</i>), having the snout a little turned
  up, slightly resembling that of the pike. The alligators of South America
  are there very often called <i>Caymans</i>. <i>A. sclerops</i> is known
  also as the <i>Spectacled Cayman</i>, from the prominent bony rim
  surrounding the orbit of each eye. The flesh of the alligator is
  sometimes eaten, the tail being considered a great delicacy by the <!--
  Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page117"></a>[117]</span>negroes. Among the fossils of the south of
  England are remains of a true alligator (<i>A. Hantoniensis</i>) in the
  Eocene beds of the Hampshire basin.</p>

  <p><b>Alligator-apple</b> (<i>An&#x14D;na palustris</i>), a fruit allied
  to the custard-apple, growing in marshy districts in Jamaica, little
  eaten on account of its narcotic properties.</p>

  <p><b>Alligator-pear</b> (<i>Pers&#x113;a gratissima</i>), an evergreen
  tree of the nat. ord. Lauraceæ, with a fruit resembling a large pear, 1
  to 2 lb. in weight, with a firm marrow-like pulp of a delicate flavour;
  called also avocado-pear, or subaltern's butter. It is a native of
  tropical America and the West Indies.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;lingham,</b> William, an Irish poet, born in Ireland in
  1824 or 1828, died in 1889. He published his first volume (<i>Poems</i>)
  in 1850; <i>Day and Night Songs</i> in 1855; <i>Lawrence Bloomfield in
  Ireland</i>, narrative poem, in 1864; <i>Songs, Poems, and Ballads</i> in
  1877 (including a number of new poems). He was a frequent contributor to
  periodicals, and for some time edited <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Allitera&prime;tion,</b> the repetition of the same letter at the
  beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at
  short intervals; as "<i>m</i>any <i>m</i>en <i>m</i>any <i>m</i>inds";
  "<i>d</i>eath <i>d</i>efies the <i>d</i>octor". "<i>A</i>pt

  "<i>P</i>uffs, <i>p</i>owders, <i>p</i>atches, <i>b</i>ibles,
  <i>b</i>illet-doux" (<i>Pope</i>). "<i>W</i>eave the <i>w</i>arp and
  <i>w</i>eave the <i>w</i>oof" (<i>Gray</i>). In the ancient German and
  Scandinavian and in early English poetry alliteration took the place of
  terminal rhymes, the alliterative syllables being made to recur with a
  certain regularity in the same position in successive verses. In the
  <i>Vision of William Concerning Piers the Ploughman</i>, for instance, it
  is regularly employed as in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

  <p>Alliteration was known to the Latin authors: "O <i>T</i>ite
  <i>t</i>ute, <i>T</i>ati, <i>t</i>ibi <i>t</i>anta, <i>t</i>yranne
  <i>t</i>ulisti" (<i>Ennius</i>). In the hands of some English poets and
  prose writers of later times alliteration became a mere conceit. It is
  still employed in Icelandic and Finnish poetry. So far has alliteration
  sometimes been carried that long compositions have been written every
  word of which commenced with the same letter. It may also be employed in
  the middle of words: "Un <i>f</i>rais par<i>f</i>um sortait des
  tou<i>ff</i>es d'as<i>f</i>odile" (<i>Victor Hugo</i>).</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;lium,</b> a genus of plants, ord. Liliaceæ;, containing
  numerous well-known species of pot-herbs. They are umbelliferous, and
  mostly perennial, herbaceous plants, but a few are biennial. Among them
  are garlic (<i>A. sat&#x12B;vum</i>), onion (<i>A. Cepa</i>), leek (<i>A.
  Porrum</i>), chives (<i>A. Sch&oelig;nopr&#x103;sum</i>), shallot (<i>A.

  them is well known.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;loa,</b> a river port of Scotland, on the north bank of
  the Forth (where there is now a bridge), 7 miles from Stirling, county of
  Clackmannan. It carries on brewing, distilling, and shipbuilding; has
  manufactures of woollens, bottles, &amp;c., and a shipping trade. Pop.
  (1921), 12,421. <!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><b>Allocu&prime;tion,</b> an address, a term particularly applied to
  certain addresses on important occasions made by the Pope to the
  cardinals, and through them to the Church in general.</p>

  <p><b>Allo&prime;dium</b> (probably derived from <i>all</i> and
  <i>odh</i>, property), land held in one's own right, without any feudal
  obligation to a superior or lord. In England, according to the theory of
  the British constitution, all land is held of the crown (by <i>feudal</i>
  tenure); the word <i>allodial</i> is, therefore, never applied to landed
  property there.</p>

  <p><b>Allogamy</b> (from the Gr. <i>allos</i>, other, and <i>gamos</i>,
  wedding), meaning the transfer of the pollen of one flower to the pistil
  of another. The opposite of allogamy is <i>autogamy</i>, or
  self-pollination.</p>

  <p><b>Allophane,</b> a hydrous aluminium silicate, with the composition
  Al<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>5</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O, forming crusts in the
  cavities of various rocks and commonly of a delicate blue colour.</p>

  <p><b>Allot&prime;ment System,</b> the system of allotting small portions
  of land (an acre or less) to farm-labourers or other workers, to be
  cultivated after their regular work by themselves and their families, a
  system believed by many to be calculated greatly to improve their
  condition. An Allotment Act for England, passed in 1887, authorizes the
  sanitary authorities in any locality to determine if there is a
  sufficient demand for allotments there, and to acquire land to be let to
  the labouring population resident in their district. Such land may be
  compulsorily acquired, due compensation being given; but land belonging
  to a park, pleasure-ground, &amp;c., is not to be so acquired. No person
  is to hold more than 1 acre as an allotment; and the rents are to be
  fixed at such amount as may reasonably be deemed sufficient to guarantee
  the sanitary authority from loss. No building is to be erected on any
  allotment other than a tool-house, pig-sty, shed, or the like. In the
  Allotment Acts of 1887 and 1892 (Scotland) the definition is applied to a
  plot of land not exceeding 1 acre, but the Local Government Act of 1894
  authorized the letting of an allotment up to the area of 4 acres to one
  person, while the Small Holdings and Allotments Act of 1907 definitely
  extends the limit of an allotment to 5 acres. The distinction between
  allotments and small holdings has therefore been obliterated, at least as
  far as England and Wales are concerned. County councils will let plots of
  1 to 5 acres as small holdings, and parish councils as allotments. During
  the European War 183,000 allotments were registered under the Cultivation
  of Lands Order, and the number of allotments in Great Britain not
  exceeding 1 acre now amounts to over 1,000,000. In proportion to the
  total agricultural area or population it is much smaller in Scotland than
  in England. The rents of allotments vary greatly, and near towns, or even
  villages, they are very high, often from £4 to £8 per acre. A measure
  corresponding to the English Small Holdings and Allotments Act of 1907
  was passed for Scotland in 1911, and came into operation in 1912. In
  recent years a large number of co-operative allotment associations have
  come into existence.</p>

  <p><b>Allot&prime;ropy</b> (Gr. <i>allos</i>, other, <i>tropos</i>,
  manner), a term used by Berzelius to express the fact that one and the
  same element may exist in different forms, differing widely in external
  physical properties. Thus carbon occurs as the diamond, and as charcoal
  and plumbago, and is therefore regarded as a substance subject to
  allotropy.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;loway,</b> a parish of Scotland, now included in Ayr
  parish. Here Burns was born in 1759, and the "auld haunted kirk", near
  his birthplace, was the scene of the dance of witches in <i>Tam o'
  Shanter</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Alloy&prime;</b> is the substance produced by melting together two
  or more metals. Sometimes a chemical compound is formed, but more
  generally one metal is interspersed throughout the other, much as sugar
  is through water in which it is dissolved. In this case the alloy is
  called a 'solid solution' of one metal in another. Many metals mix
  together in all proportions, others only in certain proportions, while
  some will not mix in any proportion.</p>

  <p>Scientific research has led to great advances in the use of alloys
  industrially. An alloy differs from its components in most of its
  physical properties, such as its hardness, ductility, strength,
  melting-point, and colour. The minutest trace of certain metals
  frequently produces an extraordinary change in the property of the body
  with which it is mixed. For instance, if bismuth is present in copper to
  the extent of more than 0.5 per cent, the copper cannot be used
  successfully in the construction of electrical machinery. Frequently the
  addition of a small proportion of a metal produces highly-desirable
  effects in one direction, but is deleterious in other directions. For
  instance, the presence of a small amount of manganese in cast-iron gives
  clean castings, but the magnetic qualities of the material are
  impaired.</p>

  <p>Alloys are classified as ferrous and non-ferrous alloys.</p>

  <p><i>Ferrous Alloys.</i>&mdash;These alloys are of great industrial
  importance, as they include cast irons and steels. Pure iron is very
  little used in industry. Ordinary <i>cast iron</i> contains iron and
  about 3 per cent of carbon. The ordinary wrought iron of the blacksmith
  contains less than 0.25 per cent of carbon. Cast iron is brittle, and
  unreliable when used to sustain tensile stresses, and it cannot be
  forged; but wrought iron can be safely used in tension, is not brittle,
  and can be forged. The raw material from which steel is <!-- Page 119
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>[119]</span>made is cast
  iron or wrought iron. (For manufacture of steel see <i>Steel</i>.) The
  properties of steel can be varied within very wide limits by adding to it
  traces of certain metals. For instance, the addition of nickel up to 5
  per cent makes the steel much stronger and tougher; the addition of
  tungsten up to about 19 per cent makes it hard (tool-steel, magnet
  steel), while molybdenum has a similar effect. Chromium and vanadium have
  a 'stabilizing' effect, i.e. tend to make large masses of the alloy
  homogeneous, and to make the alloy retain its hardness over wide ranges
  of temperature. Cobalt has a similar stabilizing effect. Molybdenum
  high-speed steel is more expensive than tungsten high-speed steel, but is
  said to wear better.</p>

  <p><i>Non-ferrous Alloys.</i>&mdash;Of the non-ferrous alloys the most
  important have copper as the basic metal. They do not become rusty on
  exposure. Copper, when used for electrical purposes, must be nearly pure.
  It is deposited electrolytically (see <i>Electrolysis</i>) and then made
  into bars (electrolytic copper).</p>

  <p><i>Brass</i> is an alloy of copper and zinc and varies much in
  composition. The best-known varieties are:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Gun-metal is a mixture of copper, tin, and zinc. The standard
  Admiralty mixture is copper 88, tin 10, zinc 2. It possesses a tensile
  strength of 14 tons per sq. inch.</p>

  <p><i>Bronzes.</i>&mdash;The bronzes are alloys of copper, with zinc or
  tin mainly. They can be cast easily, and when heated to a dull red the
  metal can be forged, stamped, rolled, pressed, or extruded. They are
  largely free from corrosion.</p>

  <p><i>Phosphor Bronze.</i>&mdash;This is a specially strong bronze. A
  typical composition is copper 89.5, tin 10, phosphorus 0.5. The tensile
  strength is higher than that of pure copper or brass (about 15 tons per
  sq. inch), and it has about one-half the electrical conductivity of pure
  copper. It is used for small castings, and it can be drawn into wire,
  which is used in alternating-current electric-railway construction for
  the overhead conductor.</p>

  <p><i>Delta metals</i> are bronzes of specially high tensile strength
  (30-50 tons per sq. inch).</p>

  <p><i>Manganese bronzes</i> are bronzes of high tensile strength and
  ductility, and are largely used for marine propellers. Manganese bronze
  is not affected by sea-water. It usually contains copper, zinc, and
  manganese, with a little aluminium and tin.</p>

  <p>A recently-discovered copper alloy is known as <i>monel metal</i>. It
  is a naturally-occurring alloy of copper, nickel, iron, and manganese
  (copper 27-29 per cent, nickel 68-70 per cent, iron and manganese 4-5 per
  cent), and possesses, roughly, the qualities of a mild steel and copper.
  It has a high tensile strength, which it retains over a wide range of
  temperature change. It is ductile, is not affected by immersion in
  sea-water, and can be machined. It is used for pump-valves, pump-pistons,
  turbine blading, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>In the British silver coinage silver is alloyed with 7.5 per cent
  copper, which renders it harder and more durable. British gold coinage
  contains 8.3 per cent of copper.&mdash;<span

  </div>

  <p><b>Allspice</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x3">&#xA8;</span></span>l&prime;sp&#x12B;s), or <b>Pimenta,</b> is
  the dried and ground berry of a West Indian species of myrtle (<i>Myrtus
  Pimenta</i>), a beautiful tree with white and fragrant aromatic flowers
  and leaves of a deep shining green. The tree is often 30 feet high, and
  may yield 150 lb. of raw berries, <!-- Page 120 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>[120]</span>equivalent to 100 lb.
  of dried spice. Pimenta is thought to resemble in flavour a mixture of
  cinnamon, nutmegs, and cloves, whence the popular name of
  <i>allspice</i>; it is also called Jamaica pepper, the trees being
  cultivated there extensively. It is employed in cookery, also in medicine
  as an agreeable aromatic, and forms the basis of a distilled water, a
  spirit, and an essential oil.</p>

  <p><b>All&prime;ston</b> (äl&prime;stun), Washington, an American

  celebrated for his pictures on scriptural subjects. Among his pictures
  <i>The Angel Uriel</i> is at Stafford House; <i>The Prophet Jeremiah</i>
  at Yale College, Newport. A portrait of Coleridge by Allston is in the
  National Gallery. He also wrote poems and a tragical romance

  such as are found in valleys and plains, consisting of loam, clay,
  gravel, &amp;c., washed down from the higher grounds. Great alterations
  are often produced by alluvium&mdash;deltas and whole islands being often
  formed by this cause. Much of the rich land along the banks of rivers is
  alluvial in its origin. There are great tracts of alluviums lying along
  the banks of the Derwent, the Ouse, and the Trent, and the Romney Marsh
  of Kent along the banks of the Thames.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;manac,</b> a calendar, in which are set down the rising
  and setting of the sun, the phases of the moon, the most remarkable
  positions and phenomena of the heavenly bodies, for every month and day
  of the year; also the several fasts and feasts to be observed in the
  Church and State, &amp;c., and often much miscellaneous information
  likely to be useful to the public. The term is of Arabic origin, but the
  Arabs were not the first to use almanacs, which indeed existed from
  remote ages. In England they are known from the fourteenth century, there
  being several English almanacs of this century existing in MS. They
  became generally used in Europe within a short time after the invention
  of printing; and they were very early remarkable, as some are still, for
  the mixture of truth and falsehood which they contained. Their effects in
  France were found so mischievous, from the pretended prophecies which
  they published, that an edict was promulgated by Henry III in 1579
  forbidding any predictions to be inserted in them relating to civil
  affairs, whether those of the State or of private persons. In the reign
  of James I of England letters-patent were granted to the two universities
  and the Stationers' Company for an exclusive right of printing almanacs,
  but in 1775 this monopoly was abolished. During the civil war of Charles
  I, and thence onward, English <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page121"></a>[121]</span>almanacs were conspicuous for the
  unblushing boldness of their astrological predictions, and their
  determined perpetuation of popular errors. The most famous English
  almanac was <i>Poor Robin's Almanack</i>, which was published from 1663
  to 1775. Gradually, however, a better taste began to prevail, and in 1828
  the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, by publishing the
  <i>British Almanac</i>, had the merit of taking the lead in the
  production of an unexceptionable almanac in Great Britain. The example
  thus set has been almost universally adopted. The circulation of almanacs
  continued to be much cramped by the very heavy duty of one shilling and
  threepence per copy till 1834, when this duty was abolished. About 200
  new almanacs were started immediately on the repeal. Almanacs, from their
  periodical character, and the frequency with which they are referred to,
  are now more and more used as vehicles for conveying statistical and
  other useful information, some being intended for the inhabitants of a
  particular country or district, others for a particular class or party.
  Some of the almanacs that are regularly published every year are
  extremely useful, and are indeed almost indispensable to men engaged in
  official, mercantile, literary, or professional business. Such in Great
  Britain are <i>Thom's Official Directory of the United Kingdom</i>,
  <i>The British Almanac</i>, <i>Oliver and Boyd's New Edinburgh
  Almanac</i>, and <i>Whitaker's Almanac</i>, started in 1868. In the
  United States is published <i>The American Almanac</i>, a useful
  compilation. The <i>Almanach de Gotha</i>, which has appeared at Gotha
  since 1764, contains in small bulk a wonderful quantity of information
  regarding the reigning families and Governments, the finances, commerce,
  population, &amp;c., of the different States throughout the world. Since
  1871 it is published both in a French and in a German edition. Among
  French almanacs the most famous was the <i>Almanach Liégeois</i>, whilst
  the <i>Almanach National</i>, first published in 1679 as <i>Almanach
  Royal</i>, is the most important of modern almanacs in France. Almanacs
  that pretend to foretell the weather and occurrences of various kinds are
  still popular in Britain, France, and elsewhere.&mdash;<i>The Nautical
  Almanac</i> is an important work published annually by the British
  Government, two or three years in advance, in which is contained much
  useful astronomical matter, more especially the distances of the moon
  from the sun, and from certain fixed stars, for every three hours of
  apparent time, adapted to the meridian of the Royal Observatory,
  Greenwich. By comparing these with the distances carefully observed at
  sea the mariner may, with comparative ease, infer his longitude to a
  degree of accuracy unattainable in any other way, and sufficient for most
  nautical purposes. This almanac was commenced in 1767 by Dr. Maskelyne,
  Astronomer Royal. The French <i>Connaissance des Temps</i> is published
  for the same purpose as the English <i>Nautical Almanac</i>, and nearly
  on the same plan. It commenced in 1679. Of a similar character is the
  <i>Astronomisches Jahrbuch</i> published at Berlin.</p>

  <p><b>Almond</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>&prime;mund), the fruit of the almond
  tree (<i>Amygd&#x103;lus comm&#x16B;nis</i>), a tree which grows usually
  to the height of 20 feet, and is akin to the peach, nectarine, &amp;c.
  (ord. Rosaceæ). It has beautiful pinkish flowers that appear before the
  leaves, which are oval, pointed, and delicately serrated. It is a native
  of Africa and Asia, naturalized in Southern Europe, and cultivated in
  England for its beauty, as it seldom produces edible fruit even in the
  warmer portions of Southern England. The fruit is a drupe, ovoid, and
  with downy outer surface; the fleshy covering is tough and fibrous; it
  covers the compressed wrinkled stone enclosing the seed or almond within
  it. There are two varieties, one sweet and the other bitter; both are
  produced from <i>A. communis</i>, though from different varieties. Most
  of the sweet almonds imported into Britain come from Southern Europe, the
  Levant, and California, the finest being the Valencian, Jordan, and
  Malaga. They contain a bland fixed oil, consisting chiefly of olein.
  Bitter almonds come from Mogador, and besides a fixed oil they contain a
  substance called <i>emulsin</i>, and also a bitter crystalline substance
  called <i>amygdalin</i>, which, acting on the emulsin, produces prussic
  acid, whence the aroma of bitter almonds when mixed with water.
  <i>Almond-oil</i>, a bland fixed oil, is expressed from the kernels of
  either sweet or bitter almonds, and is used by perfumers and in medicine.
  A poisonous essential oil is obtained from bitter almonds, which is used
  for flavouring by cooks and confectioners, also by perfumers and in
  medicine. The name <i>almond</i>, with a qualifying word prefixed, is
  also given to the seeds of other species of plants; thus <i>Java
  almonds</i> are the kernels of <i>Canarium commune</i>.</p>

    Socotrine Aloe (<i>Aloe socotr&#x12B;na</i>)
  </div>

  <p><b>Aloe</b> (al&prime;&#x14D;), the name of a number of plants
  belonging to the genus Aloë (ord. Liliaceæ), some of which are not more
  than a few inches, whilst others are 30 feet and upwards in height;
  natives of South Africa and Socotra; leaves fleshy, thick, and more or
  less spinous at the edges or extremity; flowers with a tubular corolla.
  Some of the larger kinds are of great use, the fibrous parts of the
  leaves being made into cordage, fishing nets and lines, cloth, &amp;c.
  The inspissated juice of several species is used in medicine, under the
  name of <i>aloes</i>, forming a bitter purgative. The medicinal value of
  bitter aloes was known to the Greeks in the fourth century <span
  class="scac">B.C.</span> According to the Arabian historian Edrisi, the
  occupation of Socotra by the Macedonians was due to Aristotle's
  persuading Alexander the Great to secure the monopoly of the supplies of
  the drug. The drug is said to have been commended to Alfred the Great by
  the Patriarch of Jerusalem, but a direct trade in it between Socotra and
  Britain was opened only in the seventeenth century. The principal
  drug-producing species are the Socotrine aloe (<i>A.
  Socotr&#x12B;na</i>); the Barbados aloe (<i>A. vulg&#x101;ris</i>), first
  imported into Britain in 1693; the Cape aloe (<i>A. spic&#x101;ta</i>),
  1780; and Natal aloes, 1870; &amp;c. A beautiful violet colour is yielded
  by the leaves of the Socotrine aloe. The American aloe (see <i>Agave</i>)
  is a different plant altogether; as are also the aloes or lign-aloes of
  Scripture, which are supposed to be the <i>Aquilaria
  Agall&#x14F;chum</i>, or aloes-wood (q. v.). <i>Aloe fibre</i> is
  obtained from species of Aloë, Agave, Yucca, &amp;c., and is made into
  coarse fabrics, ropes, &amp;c.</p>

  <p><b>Aloes-wood,</b> <b>Eagle-wood,</b> or <b>Agilawood,</b> the inner

  found in tropical Asia, and yielding a fragrant resinous substance,
  which, as well as the wood, is burned for its perfume. Another tree, the
  <i>Aloex&#x45E;lon Agall&#x14F;chum</i> (ord. Leguminosæ), also produces
  aloes-wood. This wood is supposed to be the lign-aloes (a corruption of

  alpacas are mutually fertile when crossed, and this explains the
  existence of intermediate forms between the two breeds. It has been
  domesticated, and remains also in a wild state. In form and size it
  approaches the sheep, but has a longer neck. It is valued chiefly for its
  long, soft, and silky wool, which is straighter than that of the sheep,
  and very strong, and is woven into fabrics of great beauty, used for
  shawls, clothing for warm climates, coat-linings, and umbrellas, and
  known by the same name. Cloth made from imported alpaca wool is
  manufactured in England, principally in Yorkshire. Attempts have been

  south-east of France, all more or less covered by the Alps or their
  offshoots:&mdash;<i>Basses-Alpes</i> (bäs-a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>lp; Lower Alps) has mountains rising to a
  height of 8000 to 10,000 feet, is drained by the Durance and its
  tributaries, and is the most thinly-peopled department in France; area,
  2697 sq. miles; capital, Digne. Pop. (1921),
  91,882.&mdash;<i>Hautes-Alpes</i> (&#x14D;t-a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>lp; Upper Alps), mostly formed out of
  ancient Dauphiné, traversed by the Cottian and Dauphiné Alps (highest
  summits 12,000 feet), drained chiefly by the Durance and its tributaries.
  It is the lowest department in France in point of absolute population;
  area, 2178 sq. miles; capital, Gap. Pop. (1921),
  89,275.&mdash;<i>Alpes-Maritimes</i> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>lp-ma<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>-ri-t&#x113;m; Maritime Alps) has the
  Mediterranean on the south, and mainly consists of the territory of Nice,
  ceded to France by Italy in 1860. The greater part of the surface is
  covered by the Maritime Alps; the principal river is the Var. It produces
  in the south, cereals, vines, olives, oranges, citrons, and other fruits;
  and there are manufactories of perfumes, liqueurs, soap, &amp;c., and
  valuable fisheries. It is a favourite resort for invalids; area, 1443 sq.
  miles; capital, Nice. Pop. 357,759.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;pha</b> and <b>O&prime;mega,</b> the first and last
  letters of the Greek alphabet, sometimes used to signify the beginning
  and the end, or the first and the last of anything; also as a symbol of
  the Divine Being (<i>Rev.</i> i, 8; xxi, 6; xxii, 13). They were also
  formerly the symbol of Christianity, and engraved accordingly on the
  tombs of the ancient Christians. Some of these engravings are to be seen
  in the Louvre.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;phabet</b> (from <i>Alpha</i> and <i>Beta</i>, the two
  first letters of the Greek alphabet), the series of characters used in
  writing a language, and intended to represent the sounds of which it
  consists. The English alphabet, like most of those of modern Europe, is
  derived directly from the Latin, the Latin from the ancient Greek, and
  that from the Ph&oelig;nician, which again is believed to have had its
  origin in the Egyptian hieroglyphics, although Egyptologists are not
  unanimous on this point. There is little evidence in support of the
  theory that the Ph&oelig;nician alphabet had developed from the Assyrian
  cuneiform. Some scholars, like Sir Arthur Evans, are of opinion that the
  Philistines established on the coast of Palestine had brought the
  alphabet over from Crete, and that from them it passed to the
  Ph&oelig;nicians. The names of the letters in Ph&oelig;nician and Hebrew
  must have been almost the same, for the Greek names, which, with the
  letters, were borrowed from the former, differ little from the Hebrew. By
  means of the names we may trace the process by which the Egyptian
  characters were transformed into letters by the Ph&oelig;nicians. Some
  Egyptian character would, by its form, recall the idea of a house, for
  example, in Ph&oelig;nician or Hebrew <i>beth</i>. This character would
  subsequently come to be used wherever the sound <i>b</i> occurred. Its
  form might be afterwards simplified, or even completely modified, but the
  name would still remain, as <i>beth</i> still continues the Hebrew name
  for <i>b</i>, and <i>beta</i> the Greek. Our letter <i>m</i>, which in
  Hebrew was called <i>mim</i>, water, has still a considerable resemblance
  to the zig-zag wavy line which had been chosen to represent water, as in
  the zodiacal symbol for <i>Aquarius</i>. The letter <i>o</i>, of which
  the Hebrew name means eye, no doubt was originally intended to represent
  that organ. While the ancient Greek alphabet gave rise to the ordinary
  Greek alphabet and the Latin, the Greek alphabet of later times furnished
  elements for the Coptic, the Gothic, and the old Slavic alphabets. The
  Latin characters are now employed by a great many nations, such as the
  Italian, the French, the Spanish, the Portuguese, the English, the Dutch,
  the German, the Hungarian, the Polish, &amp;c., each nation having
  introduced such modifications or additions as are necessary to express
  the sound of the language peculiar to it. The Greek alphabet originally
  possessed only sixteen letters, though the Ph&oelig;nician had
  twenty-two. The original Latin alphabet, as it is found in the oldest
  inscriptions, consisted of twenty-one letters; namely, the <!-- Page 125
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>[125]</span>vowels
  <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, and <i>u</i> (<i>v</i>), and the
  consonants <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>k</i>,
  <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>,
  <i>t</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>z</i>. The Anglo-Saxon alphabet had two characters
  for the digraph <i>th</i>, which were unfortunately not retained in later
  English; it had also the character <i>æ</i>. It wanted <i>j</i>,
  <i>v</i>, <i>y</i> (consonant), and <i>z</i>. The German alphabet
  consists of the same letters as the English, but the sounds of some of
  them are different. Anciently certain characters called <i>Runic</i> were
  made use of by the Teutonic nations, to which some would attribute an
  origin independent of the Greek and Latin alphabets. Wimmer, the Danish
  scholar, is, however, of opinion that the <i>runes</i> were developed
  from the Latin alphabet. While the alphabets of the west of Europe are
  derived from the Latin, the Russian, which is very complete, is based on
  the Greek, with some characters borrowed from the Armenian, &amp;c; it is
  called <i>azbouka</i>, from the first two letters <i>az</i>, a, and
  <i>bouki</i>, b. Among Asiatic alphabets, the Arabian (ultimately of
  Ph&oelig;nician origin) has played a part analogous to that of the Latin
  in Europe, the conquests of Mohammedanism having imposed it on the
  Persian, the Turkish, the Hindustani, &amp;c. The Sanskrit or
  Devan&#x101;gari alphabet is one of the most remarkable alphabets of the
  world. As now used it has fourteen characters for the vowels and
  diphthongs, and thirty-three for the consonants, besides two other
  symbols. Our alphabet is a very imperfect instrument for what it has to
  perform, being both defective and redundant. An alphabet is not essential
  to the writing of a language, since ideograms or symbols may be used
  instead, as in Chinese. See <i>Writing</i>.&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Alph&#x113;&prime;us</b> (now <b>Rufia</b>), the largest river of
  Peloponnesus, flowing westwards into the Ionian Sea. In Greek mythology
  Alph&#x113;us is supposed to have been the son of Oceanus and Tethys.</p>

  <p><b>Alphon&prime;so,</b> the name of a number of Portuguese and Spanish
  kings. Among the former may be mentioned <b>Alphonso I,</b> the
  Conqueror, first King of Portugal, son of Henry of Burgundy, the
  Conqueror and first Count of Portugal; born 1110, fought successfully
  against the Spaniards and the Moors, named himself King of Portugal, and
  was as such recognized by the Pope; died 1185.&mdash;<b>Alphonso V,</b>
  the African, born in 1432; succeeded his father, Edward I, 1438;
  conquered Tangiers in 1471; died 1481. During his reign Prince Henry the
  Navigator continued the important voyages of discovery already begun by
  the Portuguese. Under him was drawn up an important code of
  laws.&mdash;Among kings of Spain may be mentioned <b>Alphonso X,</b> King
  of Castile and Leon, surnamed the <i>Astronomer</i>, the
  <i>Philosopher</i>, or the <i>Wise</i> (El Sabio); born in 1226;
  succeeded in 1252. Being grandson of Philip of Hohenstaufen, son of
  Frederick Barbarossa, he endeavoured to have himself elected Emperor of
  Germany, and in 1257 succeeded in dividing the election with Richard,
  Earl of Cornwall. On Richard's death in 1272 he again unsuccessfully
  contested the imperial crown. Meantime his throne was endangered by
  conspiracies of the nobles and the attacks of the Moors. The Moors he
  conquered, but his domestic troubles were less easily overcome, and he
  was finally dethroned by his son Sancho, and died two years after, 1284.
  Alphonso was the most learned prince of his age. Under his direction or
  superintendence were drawn up a celebrated code of laws, valuable
  astronomical tables which go under his name (<i>Alphonsine Tables</i>),
  the first general history of Spain in the Castilian tongue, and a Spanish
  translation of the Bible.&mdash;<b>Alphonso V</b> of Aragon, I of Naples
  and Sicily, born in 1385, was the son of Ferdinand I of Aragon, the
  throne of which he ascended in 1416, ruling also over Sicily and the
  Island of Sardinia. Queen Joanna of Naples made him her heir, but after
  her death in 1435 her will was disputed by René of Anjou. Alphonso now
  proceeded to take possession of Naples by force, which he succeeded in
  doing in 1442, and reigned till his death in 1458. He was an enlightened
  patron of literary men, by whom, in the latter part of his reign, his
  Court was thronged.&mdash;<b>Alphonso XII,</b> King of Spain, the only
  son of Queen Isabella II and her cousin Francis of Assisi, was born in
  1857 and died in 1885. He left Spain with his mother when she was driven
  from the throne by the revolution of 1868, and till 1874 resided partly
  in France, partly in Austria. In the latter year he studied for a time at
  the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, being then known as Prince of the
  Asturias. His mother had given up her claims to the throne in 1870 in his
  favour, and in 1874 Alphonso came forward himself as claimant, and in the
  end of the year was proclaimed by General Martinez Campos as king. He now
  passed over into Spain and was enthusiastically received, most of the
  Spaniards being by this time tired of the republican Government, which
  had failed to put down the Carlist party. Alphonso was successful in
  bringing the Carlist struggle to an end (1876), and henceforth he reigned
  with little disturbance. His minister Canovas del Castillo ruined,
  however, Alphonso's popularity when he advised the king to conclude an
  alliance with Bismarck and Germany. He married first his cousin Maria de
  las Mercedes, daughter of the Duc de Montpensier; second, Maria
  Christina, Archduchess of Austria, whom he left a widow with two
  daughters and a son.&mdash;<b>Alphonso XIII,</b> King of Spain, born in
  1886, the posthumous son of <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>[126]</span>Alphonso XII. His mother was appointed
  regent during his minority, and acted as such until 1902. On attaining
  his sixteenth year, the king assumed personal charge of the Government.
  In 1906 (31st May) he married Princess Ena, daughter of Princess Henry of
  Battenberg, a daughter of Queen Victoria.</p>

  <p><b>Alpine Club,</b> an association of English gentlemen, originating
  in 1856 or 1857, having as their common bond of union a delight in making
  the ascent of mountains, in the Alps or elsewhere, difficult to ascend,
  and in investigating everything connected with mountains. Similar
  associations now exist in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and France.</p>

  <p><b>Alpine Crow,</b> or <b>Alpine Chough</b> (<i>Pyrrhoc&#x14F;rax
  alp&#x12B;nus</i>), a European bird closely akin to the chough of
  England.</p>

  <p><b>Alpine Museum,</b> a museum established at Munich in 1911 by the
  German and Austrian Alpine Club. Its purpose is to spread knowledge about
  the Alps, and to disseminate the results of scientific research by means
  of exhibits and literary publications. Not only alpine geology, botany,
  and zoology, but also industry, custom, and costumes are well
  demonstrated in the exhibits.</p>

  <p><b>Alpine Plants,</b> the name given to those plants whose habitat is
  in the neighbourhood of the snow, on mountains partly covered with it all
  the year round. As the height of the snow-line varies according to the
  latitude and local conditions, so also does the height at which these
  plants grow. The mean height for the alpine plants of Central Europe is
  about 6000 feet; but it rises in parts of the Alps and in the Pyrenees to
  9000 feet, or even more. The high grounds clear of snow among these
  mountains present a very well marked flora, the general characters of the
  plants being a low dwarfish habit, a tendency to form thick turfs, stems
  partly or wholly woody, and large brilliantly-coloured and often very
  sweet-smelling flowers. They are also often closely covered with woolly
  hairs. In the Alps of Middle Europe the eye is at once attracted by
  gentians, saxifrages, rhododendrons, primroses of different kinds,
  &amp;c. Ferns and mosses of many kinds also characterize these regions.
  Some alpine plants are found only in one locality. Considerable success
  has attended the attempt to grow alpine plants in gardens, the first
  necessity being a situation where there is plenty of sunlight, and which
  is free from the shade of trees.</p>

  <p><b>Alpine Warbler</b> (<i>Accentor alp&#x12B;nus</i>), a European bird
  of the same genus as the hedge-sparrow.</p>

  <p><b>Alpin&prime;ia,</b> a genus of plants. See <i>Galanga</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Alps,</b> the highest and most extensive system of mountains in
  Europe, included between lat. 44° and 48° <span class="scac">N.</span>,
  and long. 5° and 18° <span class="scac">E.</span>, covering great part of
  Northern Italy, several departments of France, nearly the whole of
  Switzerland, and a large part of Austria, while its extensive
  ramifications connect it with nearly all the mountain systems of Europe.
  The culminating peak is Mont Blanc, 15,781 feet high, though the true
  centre is the St. Gothard, or the mountain mass to which it belongs, and
  from whose slopes flow, either directly or by affluents, the great rivers
  of Central Europe&mdash;the Danube, Rhine, Rhone, and Po. Round the
  northern frontier of Italy the Alps form a remarkable barrier, shutting
  it off from the mainland of Europe, so that formerly it could hardly be
  approached from France, Germany, or Switzerland, except through high and
  difficult passes. In the west this barrier approaches close to the
  Mediterranean coast, and near Nice there is left a free passage into the
  Italian peninsula between the mountains and the sea. From this point
  eastward the chain proceeds along the coast till it forms a junction with
  the Apennines. In the opposite direction it proceeds north-west, and
  afterwards north to Mont Blanc, on the boundaries of France and Italy; it
  then turns north-east and runs generally in this direction to the Gross
  Glockner, in Central Tyrol, between the Rivers Drave and the Salza, where
  it divides into two branches, the northern proceeding north-east towards
  Vienna, the southern towards the Balkan Peninsula. The principal valleys
  of the Alps run mostly in a direction nearly parallel with the principal
  ranges, and therefore east and west. The transverse valleys are commonly
  shorter, and frequently lead up through a narrow gorge to a depression in
  the main ridge between two adjacent peaks. These are the passes or
  <i>cols</i>, which may usually be found by tracing a stream which
  descends from the mountains up to its source.</p>

  <p>The Alps in their various great divisions receive different names. The
  <i>Maritime Alps</i>, so called from their proximity to the
  Mediterranean, extend westward from their junction with the Apennines for
  a distance of about 100 miles; culminating points Aiguille de Chambeyron,
  11,155 feet, and Grand Rioburent, 11,142 feet; principal pass, the Col di
  Tende (6158 feet), which was made practicable for carriages by Napoleon
  I. Proceeding northward the next group consists of the <i>Cottian
  Alps</i>, length about 60 miles; principal peaks: Monte Viso, 12,605
  feet; Pic des Écrins, 13,462; Pelvoux, 12,973. Next come the <i>Graian
  Alps</i>, 50 miles long, with extensive ramifications in Savoy and
  Piedmont; principal peaks: Aiguille de la Sassière, 12,326 feet; Grand
  Paradis, 13,300; Grande Casse, 12,780. To this group belongs Mont Cenis
  (6765 feet), over which a carriage road was constructed by Napoleon I,
  while a railway now passes through <!-- Page 127 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>[127]</span>the mountain by a
  tunnel nearly 8 miles long. These three divisions of the Alps are often
  classed together as the <i>Western Alps</i>, while the portion of the
  system immediately east of this forms the <i>Central Alps</i>. The
  <i>Pennine Alps</i> form the loftiest portion of the whole system, having
  Mont Blanc (in France) at one extremity and Monte Rosa at the other (60
  miles), and including the Alps of Savoy and the Valais. In the east the
  valley of the Upper Rhone separates the Pennine Alps from the great chain
  of the <i>Bernese Alps</i> running nearly parallel, the great peaks of
  the two ranges being about 20 miles apart. The principal heights of the
  Pennine Alps are Mont Blanc, 15,781 feet; Monte Rosa, 15,217;
  Mischabelhörner (Dom), 14,935; Weisshorn, 14,804; Matterhorn, 14,780. In
  the Bernese Alps, the Finsteraarhorn, 14,026; Aletschhorn, 13,803;
  Jungfrau, 13,671. The pass of Great St. Bernard is celebrated for its
  hospice. The most easterly pass is the Simplon, 6595 feet, with a
  carriage road made by Napoleon I, and a tunnel leading into Italy, fully
  12 miles long. Farther east are the <i>Lepontine Alps</i>, which give off
  a number of streams that feed the Italian lakes&mdash;Maggiore, Como,
  &amp;c. The principal pass is the St. Gothard (6936 feet), over which a
  carriage road leads to Italy, while through this mountain mass a railway
  tunnel more than 9 miles long has been opened. Highest peaks: Tödi,
  11,887 feet; Monte Leone, 11,696. The <i>Rhætian Alps</i>, extending east
  to about lat. 12° 30&prime;, are the most easterly of the Central Alps,
  and are divided into two portions by the Engadine, or valley of the Inn,
  and also broken by the valley of the Adige; principal peaks: Piz Bernina,
  13,294 feet; Ortlerspitze, 12,814; Monte Adamello, 11,832. The Brenner
  Pass (4588 feet), from Verona to Innsbruck, and between the Central and
  the Eastern Alps, is crossed by a railway. On the railway from Innsbruck
  to the Lake of Constance is the Arlberg Tunnel, over 6 miles long. The
  <i>Eastern Alps</i> form the broadest and lowest portion of the system,
  and embrace the <i>Noric Alps</i>, the <i>Carnic Alps</i>, the <i>Julian
  Alps</i>, &amp;c.; highest peak, the Gross Glockner, 12,405 feet. The
  height of the south-eastern continuations of the Alps rapidly diminishes,
  and they lose themselves in ranges having nothing in common with the
  great mountain masses which distinguish the centre of the system.</p>

  <p>The Alps are very rich in lakes and streams. Among the chief of the
  former are the Lakes of Geneva, Constance, Zürich, Thun, Brienz, on the
  north side; on the south Maggiore, Como, Lugano, Garda, &amp;c. The
  drainage is carried to the North Sea by the Rhine, to the Mediterranean
  by the Rhone, to the Adriatic by the Po, to the Black Sea by the
  Danube.</p>

  <p>In the lower valleys of the Alps the mean temperature ranges from 50°
  to 60°. Half-way up the Alps it averages about 32°&mdash;a height which
  in the snowy regions it never reaches. But even where the temperature is
  lowest the solar radiation produced by the rocks and snow is often so
  great as to raise the photometer to 120° and even higher. The
  exhilarating and invigorating nature of the climate in the upper regions
  during summer has been acknowledged by all.</p>

  <p>In respect to vegetation the Alps have been divided into six zones,
  depending on height modified by exposure and local circumstances. The
  first is the olive region. This tree flourishes better on sheltered
  slopes of the mountains than on the plains of Northern Italy. The vine,
  which bears greater winter cold, distinguishes the second zone. On slopes
  exposed to the sun it flourishes to a considerable extent. The third is
  called the mountainous region. Cereals and deciduous trees form the
  distinguishing features of its vegetation. The mean temperature about
  equals that of Great Britain, but the extremes are greater. The fourth
  region is the sub-Alpine or coniferous. Here are vast forests of pines of
  various species. Most of the Alpine villages are in the two last regions.
  On the northern slopes pines grow to 6000, and on the southern slopes to
  7000 feet above the level of the sea. This is also the region of the
  lower or permanent pastures where the flocks are fed in winter. The fifth
  is the pasture region, the term <i>alp</i> being used in the local sense
  of high pasture grounds. It extends from the uppermost limit of trees to
  the region of perpetual snow. Here there are shrubs, rhododendrons,
  junipers, bilberries, and dwarf willows, &amp;c. The sixth zone is the
  region of perpetual snow. The line of snow varies, according to seasons
  and localities, from 8000 to 9500 feet, but the line is not continuous,
  being often broken in upon. Few flowering plants extend above 10,000
  feet, but they have been found as high as 12,000 feet.</p>

  <p>At this great elevation are found the wild goat and the chamois. In
  summer the high mountain pastures are covered with large flocks of
  cattle, sheep, and goats, which are in winter removed to a lower and
  warmer level. The marmot, and white or Alpine hare, inhabit both the
  snowy and the woody regions. Lower down are found the wild-cat, fox,
  lynx, bear, and wolf; the last two are now extremely rare. The vulture,
  eagle, and other birds of prey frequent the highest elevations, the
  ptarmigan seeks its food and shelter among the diminutive plants that
  border upon the snow-line. Excellent trout and other fish are found; but
  the most elevated lakes are, from their low temperature, entirely
  destitute of fish. <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page128"></a>[128]</span></p>

  <p>The geological structure of the Alps is highly involved, and is far,
  as yet, from being thoroughly investigated or understood. In general
  three zones can be distinguished, a central, in which crystalline rocks
  prevail, and two exterior zones, in which sedimentary rocks predominate.
  The rocks of the central zone consist of granite, gneiss, hornblende,
  mica slate, and other slates and schists. In the western Alps there are
  also considerable elevations in the central zone that belong to the
  Jurassic (Oolite) and Cretaceous formations. From the disposition of the
  beds, which are broken, tilted, and distorted on a gigantic scale, the
  Alps appear to have been formed by a succession of disruptions and
  elevations extending over a very protracted period. Among the minerals
  that are obtained are iron and lead, gold, silver, copper, zinc, alum,
  and coal.</p>

  <p>Extensive views of alpine scenery are now commanded by means of
  special railways climbing to the summit of Mont Blanc, the Jungfrau, and
  other mountains. The Rigi railway was one of the earliest constructed of
  these. Here there are hotels at the top, 5905 feet above the level of the
  sea, and 4468 above the Lake of Lucerne. A favourite view from hence is
  to watch the sun rise over the Bernese Alps. The Becca di Nona (8415
  feet), south of Aosta, gives, according to some authorities, the finest
  panoramic view to be obtained from any summit of the Alps. The most
  accessible glaciers are those of Aletsch, Chamonix, and Zermatt.</p>

  revolution a province of France, on the Rhine, afterwards constituting
  the French departments of Haut- and Bas-Rhin, and subsequently to the
  Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1 annexed by Germany, and incorporated in the
  province of Elsass-Lothringen (Alsace-Lorraine). Alsace is generally a
  level country, though there are several ranges of low hills richly
  wooded. The principal river is the Ill. Corn, flax, tobacco, grapes, and
  other fruits are grown. Area, 3202 sq. miles. Pop. 1,218,803. Alsace was
  originally a part of ancient Gaul. It afterwards became a dukedom of the
  German Empire. In 1268, the line of its dukes becoming extinct, it was
  parcelled out to several members of the empire. By the peace of
  Westphalia, in 1648, a great part of it was ceded to France, which
  afterwards seized the rest of it, this seizure being recognized by the
  peace of Ryswick, in 1697.</p>

  <p><b>Alsace-Lorraine,</b> the imperial territory, or Reichsland of
  Elsass-Lothringen, taken by Germany from France in 1871, and restored to
  France in 1919. The province is partly bounded by the Rhine; area, 5605
  sq. miles. Pop. 1,874,014. Under the German system the province was
  divided into three districts, namely, Lorraine, Upper Alsace, and Lower
  Alsace, and governed by a Statthalter, having his seat at Strassburg. By
  the law of 31st May, 1911, a constitution was granted to Alsace-Lorraine,
  by which it received three votes in the Federal Council. After the
  signing of the armistice, French troops occupied Alsace-Lorraine, and the
  French Government, by a decree of 26th Nov., 1918, took over the
  administration of the restored territories, and French officials were
  installed. The three chief towns are Strassburg, Mulhausen, and Metz.
  About 76 per cent of the inhabitants are Roman Catholics, 22 per cent
  Evangelical, and between 1 and 2 per cent Jews. The chief crops are
  wheat, rye, barley, oats, potatoes, and hay; the potash deposits of
  Alsace are superior to and more extensive than those of Strassfurt,
  Germany. <i>See France; Moselle.</i>&mdash;<span

  <p><b>Altaic Languages</b> (also called <b>Ural-Altaic</b> and
  <b>Turanian</b>), a family of languages occupying a portion of Northern
  and Eastern Europe, and nearly the whole of Northern and Central Asia,
  <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p><b>Altai Mountains</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x2">&#x2D9;</span></span>l&prime;t&#x12B;), an important Asiatic
  system on the borders of Siberia and Mongolia, partly in Russian and
  partly in Chinese territory, between lat. 46° and 53° <span
  class="scac">N.</span>, long. 83° and 91° <span class="scac">E.</span>,
  but having great eastern extensions. The Russian portion is comprised in
  the governments of Tomsk and Semipalatinsk, the Chinese in Dsungaria. The
  rivers of this region, which are large and numerous, are mostly
  headwaters of the Obi and Irtish. The mountain scenery is generally grand
  and interesting. The highest summit is Byeluka ('white mountain', from
  its snowy top), height 11,000 feet. The area covered by perpetual snow is
  very considerable, and glaciers occupy a large area. In the high lands
  the winter is very severe, but on the whole the climate is comparatively
  mild and is also healthy. The flora of the Altai Mountains greatly
  resembles that of the Alps, about five-sixths of the latter being found
  here. The mountain forests are composed of birch, alder, aspen, fir,
  larch, stone-pine, &amp;c. The wild sheep has here its native home, and
  several kinds of deer are found. The Altai is exceedingly rich in
  minerals, including gold, silver, copper, and iron. The name Altai means
  'gold mountain'. The inhabitants are chiefly Russians and Kalmuks. The
  chief town is Barnaul.</p>

  <p><b>Altamu&prime;ra,</b> a town of South Italy, province of Bari, at

  <p><b>Altar</b> (a<span class="x1"><span
  class="x3">&#xA8;</span></span>l&prime;tar), any pile or structure raised
  above the ground for receiving sacrifices to some divinity. Amongst the
  Semites the altar was primarily the place where the victim was
  slaughtered, and amongst the Indo-Germanic peoples the place where it was
  burnt. The Greek and Roman altars were various in form, and often highly
  ornamental; in temples they were usually placed before the statue of the
  god. In the Jewish ceremonial the altar held an important place, and was
  associated with many of the most significant rites of religion. Two
  altars were erected in the tabernacle in the wilderness, and the same
  number in the temple. In most sections of the Christian Church the
  communion-table, or table on which the eucharist is placed, is called an
  altar. In the primitive Church it was a table of wood, but subsequently
  stone and metal were introduced with rich ornaments, sculpture, and
  painting. After the introduction of Gothic art the altar frequently
  became a lofty and most elaborate structure. Originally there was but one
  altar in a church, but later on there might be several in a large church,
  the chief or <i>high altar</i> standing at the east end. Over an altar
  there is often a painting (an <i>altar-piece</i>), and behind it there
  may be an ornamental <i>altar-screen</i> separating the choir from the
  east end of the church.</p>

  <p><b>Altaz&prime;imuth</b> (also called <b>Universal Instrument</b>), an
  astronomical instrument similar to a theodolite, having a telescope so
  mounted that it can be turned round in a plane perpendicular to the
  horizon, while it and the graduated vertical circle connected can also be
  turned horizontally to any point of the compass above a graduated
  horizontal circle. The altazimuth can thus determine the altitude and
  azimuth of objects, hence the name.</p>

  &amp;c., which, administered in small doses, gradually induce a change in
  the habit or constitution, and imperceptibly alter disordered secretions
  and actions, and restore healthy functions without producing any sensible
  evacuation by perspiration, purging, or vomiting.</p>

  <p><b>Alter ego</b> (Lat., 'another I'), a second self, one who
  represents another in every respect. This term was formerly given, in the
  official style of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, to a substitute
  appointed by the king to manage the affairs of the kingdom, with full
  royal power.</p>

  person is enabled to overlook an object (a parapet, for instance)
  intervening between himself and any view that he desires to see, the
  picture of the latter being reflected from a higher to a lower mirror,
  where it is seen by the observer.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;titude,</b> in mathematics, the perpendicular height of
  the vertex or apex of a plane figure or solid above the base. In
  astronomy it is the vertical height of any point or body above the
  horizon. It is measured or estimated by the angle subtended between the
  object and the plane of the horizon, and may be either <i>true</i> or
  <i>apparent</i>. The <i>apparent</i> altitude is that which is obtained
  immediately from observation; the <i>true</i> altitude, that which
  results from correcting the apparent altitude, by making allowance for
  parallax, refraction, &amp;c. Altitude is one of the main determining
  influences of local climate. Its increase has the same effect on
  temperature as an increase of distance north or south of the equator.</p>

  <p><b>Alto,</b> in music, the highest singing voice of a male adult, the
  lowest of a boy or a woman, being in the latter the same as
  <i>contralto</i>. The alto, or <i>counter-tenor</i>, is not a natural

  <p><b>Al&prime;um,</b> a well-known crystalline, astringent substance
  with a sweetish taste, a double sulphate of potassium and aluminium with
  water of crystallization; formula,
  K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.24
  H<sub>2</sub>O. It crystallizes in colourless regular octahedra. Its
  solution reddens vegetable blues. When heated, its water of
  crystallization is driven off, and it becomes light and spongy with
  slightly corrosive properties, and is used as a caustic under the name of
  <i>burnt alum</i>. Alum is prepared in Great Britain at Whitby from
  alum-slate&mdash;where it forms the cliffs for miles&mdash;and was once
  manufactured near Glasgow from bituminous alum-shale and slate-clay,
  obtained from old coal-pits. It is also prepared near Rome from
  alum-stone. Common alum is strictly <i>potash</i> alum; other two
  varieties are <i>soda</i> alum and <i>ammonia</i> alum, both similar in
  properties. <i>Iron alum</i> (pale mauve) and <i>chrome alum</i> (deep
  purple) are compounds containing iron and chromium in place of aluminium.
  Alum is employed to harden tallow, to remove grease from printers'
  cushions and blocks in calico manufactories, and in dyeing as a mordant.
  It is also largely used in the composition of crayons, in tannery, and in
  medicine (as an astringent and styptic). Wood and paper are dipped in a
  solution of alum to render them less combustible.</p>

  <p><b>Alumbagh</b> (<i>a</i>-l<i>a</i>m-bäg&prime;), a palace and
  connected buildings in Hindustan, about 4 miles south of Lucknow. On the
  outbreak of the Indian Mutiny it was occupied by the revolted sepoys, and
  converted into a fort. On the 23rd Sept., 1857, it was captured by the
  British, and during the following winter a British garrison, under Sir
  James Outram, held out there, though repeatedly attacked by overwhelming
  numbers of the rebels, till in March, 1858, it was finally relieved. Sir
  Henry Havelock was buried within the grounds.</p>

  <p><b>Alu&prime;mina</b> (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), the single oxide
  of the metal aluminium. As found native it is called corundum, when
  crystallized ruby or sapphire, when amorphous emery. It is next to the
  diamond in hardness. In combination with silica it is one of the most
  widely distributed of substances, as it enters in large quantity into the
  composition of granite, traps, slates, schists, clays, loams, and other
  rocks. The porcelain clays and kaolins contain about half their weight of
  this earth, to which they owe their most valuable properties. It forms
  compounds with certain colouring matters, which causes it to be employed
  in the preparation of the colours called <i>lakes</i> in dyeing and
  calico-printing. It combines with the acids and forms numerous salts, the
  most important of which are the sulphate (see <i>Alum</i>) and acetate,
  the latter of extensive use as a mordant.</p>

  <p><b>Alumin&prime;ium</b> (symbol Al, atomic weight 27.1), a metal
  discovered in 1827, but nowhere found native, although its oxide, alumina
  (which see), is abundantly distributed. The minerals <i>bauxite</i> and
  <i>cryolite</i> are sources of aluminium, but the chief source is the
  pure oxide, from which the metal is obtained by means of a strong
  electric current. It is a shining white metal, of a colour between that
  of silver and platinum, very light (specific gravity, 2.56 cast, 2.67
  hammered), not liable to tarnish nor undergo oxidation in the air, very
  ductile and malleable, and remarkably sonorous. It forms several useful
  alloys with iron and copper; one of the latter (<i>aluminium gold</i>)
  much resembles gold, and is made into cheap trinkets. Another, known as
  <i>aluminium bronze</i>, possesses great hardness and tenacity. Spoons,
  tea and coffee pots, dish-covers, musical and mathematical instruments,
  trinkets, &amp;c., are made of aluminium.</p>

  <p><b>Alum-root,</b> the name given in America to two plants from the
  remarkable astringency of their roots, which are used for medical
  purposes: <i>Ger&#x101;nium macul&#x101;tum</i> and <i>Heuch&#x115;ra
  americ&#x101;na</i> (nat. ord. Saxifragaceæ).</p>

  <p><b>Alum-slate,</b> or <b>Alum-schist,</b> a slaty rock from which much
  alum is prepared; colour greyish, bluish, or iron-black; often possessed
  of a glossy or shining lustre; chiefly composed of clay (silicate of
  alumina), with variable proportions of sulphide of iron (iron-pyrites),
  lime, bitumen, and magnesia.</p>

  <p><b>Alum-stone.</b> See <i>Alunite</i>.</p>

  <p><b>Alunite,</b> a mineral sulphate of aluminium and potassium, greyish
  or yellowish white, from which alum is prepared in Sicily by roasting and
  lixiviation. It is regarded as a possible source <!-- Page 132 --><span

  agriculture and also of aluminium. A considerable vein occurs in
  Utah.</p>

  <p><b>Al&prime;va,</b> or <b>Al&prime;ba,</b> Ferdinand Alvarez, Duke of,
  Spanish statesman and general under Charles V and Philip II, was born in
  1508; early embraced a military career, and fought in the wars of Charles
  V in France, Italy, Africa, Hungary, and Germany. He is more especially
  remembered for his bloody and tyrannical government of the Netherlands
  (1567-73), which had revolted, and which he was commissioned by Philip II
  to reduce to entire subjection to Spain. Among his first proceedings was
  to establish the 'Council of Blood', a tribunal which condemned, without
  discrimination, all whose opinions were suspected, and whose riches were
  coveted. The present and absent, the living and the dead, were subjected
  to trial and their property confiscated. Many merchants and mechanics
  emigrated to England; people by hundreds of thousands abandoned their
  country. The Counts of Egmont and Horn, and other men of rank, were
  executed, and William and Louis of Orange had to save themselves in
  Germany. The most oppressive taxes were imposed, and trade was brought
  completely to a standstill. As a reward for his services to the faith the
  Pope presented him with a consecrated hat and sword, a distinction
  previously conferred only on princes. Resistance was only quelled for a
  time, and soon the provinces of Holland and Zealand revolted against his
  tyranny. A fleet which was fitted out at his command was annihilated, and
  he was everywhere met with insuperable courage. Hopeless of finally
  subduing the country he asked to be recalled, and accordingly, in Dec.,
  1573, Alva left the country, in which, as he himself boasted, he had
  executed 18,000 men. He was received with distinction in Madrid, but did
  not long enjoy his former credit. He had the honour, however, before his
  death (which took place in 1582) of reducing all Portugal to subjection
  to his sovereign. It is said of him that during sixty years of warfare he
  never lost a battle and was never taken by surprise.</p>

  Spanish 'conquistadores', was born towards the end of the fifteenth
  century, and died in 1541. Having crossed the Atlantic, he was associated
  (1519) with Cortez in his expedition to conquer Mexico; and was entrusted
  with important operations. In July, 1520, during the disastrous retreat
  from the capital after the death of Montezuma, the perilous command of
  the rear-guard was assigned to Alvarado. On his return to Spain he was
  received with honour by Charles V, who made him governor of Guatemala,
  which he had himself conquered. To this was subsequently added Honduras.
  He continued to add to the Spanish dominions in America till his
  death.</p>

  He was chosen regent of Piedmont; but after this elevation retired from
  his throne and family into a religious house. He now aspired to the
  papacy, and was chosen by the Council of Basel (1439), becoming Pope, or
  rather anti-Pope, under the name of Felix V, though he had never taken
  holy orders. He was recognized as Pope by only a few princes, and
  resigned in 1449, being the last of the anti-Popes. He died in 1451.</p>

  second son of Victor Emanuel of Italy, and brother of Humbert I, King of
  Italy. He was born in 1845, and, thanks to the influence of Marshals Prim
  and Serrano, was chosen by the Cortes King of Spain in 1870, Queen
  Isabella having had to leave the country in 1868. He made his entrance

  <p><b>Amako&prime;sa,</b> one of the Kaffir tribes of S. Africa.</p>

  <p><b>Amalasun&prime;tha,</b> daughter of Theodoric, king of the
  Ostrogoths, and after his death regent of Italy for her son Athalarich.
  Athalarich died in 534, after which Amalasuntha married her cousin
  Theodahad, but retained the power in her own hands. Mainly on this
  account she was imprisoned and strangled in her bath by order of her
  second husband, <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 535.</p>

  <p><b>Amal&prime;ekites,</b> an ancient tribe occupying the peninsula
  between Egypt and Palestine, named after a grandson of Esau. They were
  denounced by Moses for their hostility to the Israelites during their
  journey through the wilderness, and they seem to have been all but
  exterminated by Saul and David. The Kenites seem to have been a branch of
  the Amalekites.</p>

  <p><b>Amal&prime;fi,</b> a seaport in Southern Italy, on the Gulf of
  Salerno, 23 miles from Naples, the seat of an archbishop. In the early
  part of the Middle Ages it was a place of great commercial importance,
  and it long enjoyed a republican constitution of its own. Quarrels with
  its neighbours, encroachments of the sea, and other causes led to its
  downfall, but it is still much visited by tourists. The road from Salerno
  to Amalfi is a magnificent carriage-way, partly hewn in the cliffs, and
  affords charming views. Amalfi is surrounded by rocky heights, and its
  harbour was choked up by a landslip in 1900. Here arose the <i>Amalfian
  Code</i> of maritime law, composed in 1010 and containing 66 articles,
  which once had great influence in the maritime affairs of the
  Mediterranean trading peoples. The MS. was discovered by the Prince of
  Andorra, in 1844, in the imperial library at Vienna. Pop. 7472.</p>

  <p><b>Amal&prime;gam,</b> a name applied to the alloys of mercury with
  the other metals. One of them is the amalgam of mercury with tin, which
  is used to silver looking-glasses. Mercury unites very readily with gold
  and silver at ordinary temperatures, and advantage is taken of this to
  separate them from their ores, the process being called
  <i>amalgamation</i>. The mercury dissolves and combines with the precious
  metal and separates it from the waste matters, and is itself easily
  driven off by heat. An amalgam made of cadmium and copper is frequently
  used in dentistry, and an amalgam of zinc and tin is used for the rubbers
  of frictional electric machines. <!-- Page 134 --><span

  seventeenth centuries. Andrea (about 1540-1600) was the founder of the
  business, which was carried on by his sons Geronimo and Antonio, and by
  Niccolo the son of Geronimo. The first instrument signed Amati bears the
  date 1546. Most of the violins made by them are of comparatively small
  size and flat model, and the tone produced by the fourth or G string is
  somewhat thin and sharp. Many of Niccolo Amati's violins are, however, of
  a larger size and have all the fulness and intensity of tone
  characteristic of those manufactured by Stradivario and Guarnerio.</p>

  <p><b>Amauro&prime;sis</b> (Gr. <i>amauros</i>, dark), a species of
  blindness, formerly called <i>gutta serena</i> (the 'drop serene', as
  Milton, whose blindness was of this sort, called it), caused by disease
  of the nerves of vision. The most frequent causes are a long-continued
  direction of the eye on minute objects, long exposure to a bright light,
  to the fire of a forge, to snow, or irritating gases, overfulness of
  blood, disease of the brain, &amp;c. If taken in time it may be cured or
  mitigated; but, unless caused by loss of blood, by lead-poisoning, or
  debility, it is usually incurable.</p>

  Peru, the former from Lake Lauricocha, in lat. 10° 29&prime; <span
  class="scac">S.</span>, the latter formed by the Apurimac and Urubamba,
  the headwaters of which are between lat. 14° and 16° <span
  class="scac">S.</span>; general course north of east; length, including
  windings, between 3000 and 4000 miles; area of drainage basin, 2,500,000
  sq. miles. It enters the Atlantic under the equator by a mouth 200 miles
  wide, divided into two principal and several smaller arms by the large
  island Marajo and a number of smaller islands. In its upper course
  navigation is interrupted by rapids, but from its mouth upwards for a
  distance of 3300 miles (mostly in Brazil) there is no obstruction. It
  receives the waters of about 200 tributaries, 100 of which are navigable
  and seventeen of these 1000 to 2300 miles in length; northern
  tributaries: Santiago, Morona, Pastaça, Tigre, Napo, Putumayo, Japura,
  Rio Negro (the Cassiquiare connects this stream with the Orinoco),
  &amp;c.; southern: Huallaga, Ucayali, Javari, Jutay, Jurua, Coary, Purus,
  Madeira, Tapajos, Xingu, &amp;c. At Tabatinga, where it enters Brazilian
  territory, the breadth is 1½ miles; below the mouth of the Madeira it is
  3 miles wide, and where there are islands often as much as 7; from the
  sea to the Rio Negro, 750 miles in a straight line, the depth is nowhere
  less than 30 fathoms; up to the junction of the Ucayale there is depth
  sufficient for the largest vessels. The Amazonian water system affords
  some 50,000 miles of river suitable for navigation. The rapidity of the
  river is considerable, especially during the rainy season (Jan. to June),
  when it is subject to floods; but there is no great fall in its course.
  The tides reach up as far as 400 miles from its mouth. The singular
  phenomenon of the <i>bore</i>, or as it is called on the Amazon the
  <i>pororoca</i>, occurs at the mouth of the river at spring-tides on a
  grand scale. The river swarms with alligators, turtles, and a great
  variety of fish. The country through which it flows is extremely fertile,
  and is mostly covered with immense forests; it must at some future time
  support a numerous population, and be the theatre of a busy commerce.
  Steamers and other craft ply on the river, the chief centre of trade
  being Para, at its mouth. The Amazon was discovered by Vicente Yañez
  Pinzon in 1500, but the stream was not navigated by any European till
  1541, when Francis Orellana descended it. Orellana stated that he found
  on its banks a nation of armed women, and this circumstance gave the name
  to the river.</p>

  <p><b>Am&prime;azons,</b> according to an ancient Greek tradition, the
  name of a community of women, who permitted no men to reside among them,
  fought under the conduct of a queen, and long constituted a formidable
  State. They were said to burn off the right breast that it might not
  impede them in the use of the bow&mdash;a legend that arose from the
  Greeks supposing the name was from <i>a</i>, not, <i>mazos</i>, breast.
  It is probably from <i>a</i>, together, and <i>mazos</i>, breast, the
  name meaning therefore sisters. Several nations of Amazons are mentioned,
  the most famous being those who dwelt in Pontus, who built Ephesus and
  other cities. Their queen, Hippolyta, was vanquished by Hercules, who
  took from her the girdle of Mars. They attacked Attica in the time of
  Theseus. They came to the assistance of Troy under their queen,
  Penthesil&#x113;a, who was slain by Achilles.</p>

  <p><b>Ambas&prime;sador,</b> a minister of the highest rank, employed by
  one prince or State at the Court of another to manage the public
  concerns, or support the interests of his own prince or State, and
  representing the power and dignity of his sovereign or State. Ambassadors
  are <i>ordinary</i> when they reside permanently at a foreign Court, or
  <i>extraordinary</i> when they are sent on a special occasion. When
  <i>ambassadors extraordinary</i> have full powers, as of concluding
  peace, making treaties, and the like, they are called
  <i>plenipotentiaries</i>. Ambassadors are often called simply
  <i>ministers</i>. <i>Envoys</i> are ministers employed on special
  occasions, and are of less dignity than ambassadors. The term
  <i>ambassador</i>, however, is also used in a more general sense for any
  diplomatic agent or minister. An ambassador and his suite are not
  amenable to the laws of the country in which they are residing. See
  <i>Diplomacy</i>.</p>

  translucent, and possessed of a resinous lustre. Specific gravity, 1.065.
  It burns with a yellow flame, emitting a pungent aromatic smoke, and
  leaving a light carbonaceous residue, which is employed as the basis of
  the finest black varnishes. By friction it becomes strongly electric. It
  is found in masses from the size of coarse sand to that of a man's head,
  and occurs in beds of bituminous wood situated upon the shores of the
  Baltic and Adriatic Seas; also in Poland, France, Italy, and Denmark. It
  is often washed up on the Prussian shores of the Baltic, and is also
  obtained by fishing for it with nets. Sometimes it is found on the east
  coast of Britain, in gravel pits round London, also in the United
  States.</p>

  Dutch residency or province of Amboyna, which includes also Ceram, Buru,
  &amp;c. Its surface is generally hilly or mountainous, its general aspect
  beautiful, and its climate on the whole salubrious, but frequently
  visited by earthquakes. It affords a variety of useful trees, including
  the coco-nut and sago palms. Cloves and nutmegs are the staple
  productions. The soil in the valleys and along the shores is very
  fertile, but a large portion remains uncultivated. The natives are mostly
  of Malayan race. The capital, also called <i>Amboyna</i>, is situated on
  the Bay of Amboyna, and is well built and defended by a citadel. The
  streets are planted on each side with rows of fruit-trees. It is a free
  port. Pop. 10,000. In 1607 Amboyna and the other Moluccas were taken by
  the Dutch from the Portuguese, and it was for some years the seat of
  government of the Dutch East Indies. Trade with the Moluccas was secured
  to the British by treaty in 1619, but the British establishment was
  destroyed and several persons massacred in 1623, an outrage for which no
  satisfaction was obtained till Cromwell obtained it in 1654. Amboyna was
  taken by the British in 1796 and 1810, but each time restored to the
  Dutch. Pop. about 40,000. The Dutch residency of Amboyna, including the
  Banda group, Ceram, Buru, and other islands, has an area of 19,870 sq.

  <p><b>Am&prime;brose,</b> Saint, a celebrated father of the Church; born
  in <span class="scac">A.D.</span> 333 or 334, probably at Trèves, where
  his father was prefect; died in 397. He was educated at Rome, studied
  law, practised as a pleader at Milan, and in 369 was appointed governor
  of Liguria and Æmilia (North Italy). His kindness and wisdom gained him
  the esteem and love of the people, and in 374 he was unanimously called
  to the bishopric of Milan, though not yet baptized. For a time he refused
  to accept this dignity, but he had to give way, and at once ranged
  himself against the Arians. In his struggles against the Arian heresy he
  was opposed by Justina, mother of Valentinian II, and for a time by the
  young emperor himself, together with the courtiers and the Gothic troops.
  Backed by the people of Milan, however, he felt strong enough to deny the
  Arians the use of a single church in the city, although Justina, in her
  son's name, demanded that two should be given up. He had also to carry on
  a war with paganism, Symmachus, the prefect of the city, an eloquent
  orator, having endeavoured to restore the worship of heathen deities. In
  390, on account of the ruthless massacres at Thessalonica ordered by the
  emperor Theodosius, he refused him entrance into the church of Milan for
  eight months. The later years of his life were devoted to the more
  immediate care of his see. His writings, which are numerous, show that
  his theological knowledge extended little beyond an acquaintance with the
  works of the Greek fathers. He wrote Latin hymns, but the <i>Te Deum
  Laudamus</i>, which has been ascribed to him, was written a century
  later. He introduced the <i>Ambrosian Chant</i>, a mode of singing more
  monotonous than the Gregorian, which superseded it. He also compiled a
  form of ritual known by his name. The best edition of his works is that
  published in Paris, 1686-90, in 2 vols. fol., and reissued at Lyons in
  1853.</p>

  <p><b>Ambrosian Library,</b> a public library in Milan founded by the
  cardinal archbishop Federigo Borromeo, a relation of St. Charles
  Borromeo, who sent scholars, among them Antonio Olgiati, all over Europe
  to acquire books. The library was opened in 1609, now containing 230,000
  printed books and many MSS., among the latter being the famous collection
  of Pinelli. It was named in honour of St. Ambrose, the patron saint of
  Milan.</p>

  dilate with water and thus move forward.</p>

  <p><b>Am&prime;bulance (Field),</b> a military medical unit attached to
  an army in the field for the purpose of providing medical and surgical
  first-aid to sick and wounded immediately behind the fighting-line. The
  term field-ambulance was adopted in the British service in 1905-6. The
  chief and most important duty of a field-ambulance is to relieve fighting
  troops of their sick and wounded and transfer them to the rear to the
  collecting-hospitals, known as Casualty Clearing Stations, situated at
  the head of the line of communications to the army's base. Three
  field-ambulances are attached to each division in the field, one to each
  brigade, and their officers and men are divided into bearer and nursing
  sections and equipped with horse or mule and motor transport for wounded
  and sick. In the East sick and wounded are often carried in litters on
  camel-back, two of the cacolets being balanced against each other. A
  medical ambulance is theoretically able to undertake any hospital work,
  but in practice it confines itself when in action with its division to
  clearing the front line, and when at rest to treating the minor maladies
  such as lice, scabies, and slight illnesses which do not require much
  time or equipment. The medical and surgical outfit of an ambulance is
  carried in panniers and is usually in excess of its requirements. The
  word ambulance is often used to designate the motors or other vehicles
  employed by military or civil authorities in carrying the sick and
  wounded.&mdash;<span class="sc">Bibliography</span>: M.&nbsp;M. Bird, <i>The

  <p><b>Amen</b> (&#x101;-men&prime;), a Hebrew word, signifying 'verily',
  'truly', transferred from the religious <!-- Page 138 --><span

  that of the Christians, and used at the end of prayers as equivalent to
  'so be it', 'may this be granted'.</p>

  <p><b>Amend&prime;ment,</b> a proposal brought forward in a meeting of
  some public or other body, either in order to get an alteration
  introduced into some proposal already before the meeting, or entirely to
  overturn such proposal. In Parliament an amendment denotes an alteration
  made in the original draft of a Bill whilst it is passing through the
  houses. Amendments may be made so as totally to alter the nature of the
  proposition; and this is a way of getting rid of a proposition, by making
  it bear a sense different from what was intended by the movers, who are
  thus compelled to abandon it.</p>

  <p><b>Amer&prime;ica,</b> or the <b>New World,</b> the largest of the
  great divisions of the globe except Asia, is washed on the west by the
  Pacific, on the east by the Atlantic, on the north by the Arctic Ocean,
  while on the south it tapers to a point. On the north-west it approaches
  within about 50 miles of Asia, while on the north-east the island of
  Greenland approaches within 370 miles of the European island Iceland; but
  in the south the distance between the American mainland and Europe or
  Africa is very great. Extreme points of the continent&mdash;north,

  class="scac">W.</span> America as a whole forms the two triangular
  continents of North and South America, united by the narrow Isthmus of
  Panama, and having an entire length of about 10,000 miles; a maximum
  breadth (in North America) of 3500 miles; a coast-line of 44,000 miles;
  and a total area, including the islands, of over 16,000,000, of which N.
  America contains about 8,300,000 sq. miles. South America is more compact
  in form than N. America, in this respect resembling Africa, while N.
  America more resembles Europe. Between the two on the east side is the
  great basin which comprises the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and
  the West India Islands. Like Europe also N. America possesses numerous
  islands, while those of S. America are less important and confined almost
  to the southern extremity.</p>

  <p>Three-fourths of the area of America is comparatively flat, and this
  portion of the surface is bounded on the west by lofty mountain systems
  which stretch continuously from north to south between the extremities of
  the continent, generally at no great distance from the west shore. In
  North America the Rocky Mountains, a broad series of masses partly
  consisting of plateaux, form the most important portion of the elevated
  surface, being continued southward in the mountains and tableland of
  Mexico and the ranges of Central America. Separated by depressions from
  the Rocky Mountains proper, and running close to and parallel with the
  western coast, are several lofty ranges (Sierra Nevada, Cascade
  Mountains, &amp;c.). Near the eastern coast, and forming an isolated
  mass, are the Appalachians, a system of much inferior magnitude. The
  loftiest mountains in N. America are M&lsquo;Kinley (20,470 feet), in
  Alaska; <!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page139"></a>[139]</span>Logan (19,514 feet), in N.&nbsp;W. Canada; and
  Popocatepetl (18,000 feet). The depression of the Isthmus of Panama
  (about 260 feet) forms a natural separation between the systems of the
  north and the south. In S. America the Andes form a system of greater
  elevation but less breadth than the Rocky Mountains, and consist of a
  series of ranges (<i>cordilleras</i>) closely following the line of the
  west coast from the Isthmus of Panama to Cape Horn. The highest summits
  are Aconcagua (23,080 feet), Sorata or Illampu (21,484), and Sahama
  (21,054). Volcanoes are numerous. Isolated mountain groups of minor
  importance are the highlands of Venezuela and of Brazil, the latter near
  the eastern coast, reaching a height of 10,000 feet.</p>

  <p>The fertile lowlands which lie to the east of the Rocky Mountains and
  the Andes form a depression extending through both continents from the
  northern to the southern oceans. They have somewhat different features
  and different names in different portions; in N. America are
  <i>prairies</i> and <i>savannahs</i>, in S. America <i>llanos</i>,
  <i>selvas</i>, and <i>pampas</i>.</p>

  <p>Through these low grounds flow the numerous great rivers which form so
  characteristic a feature of America. The principal are the Mackenzie,
  Coppermine, and Great Fish Rivers, entering the Northern Ocean; the
  Churchill, Nelson, Severn, and Albany, entering Hudson's Bay; the St.
  Lawrence, entering the Atlantic; Mississippi and Rio del Norte, entering
  the Gulf of Mexico (all these being in N. America); the Magdalena,
  Orinoco, Amazon, Paranahiba, Rio de la Plata, Colorado, and Rio Negro,
  entering the Atlantic (all in S. America); and the Yukon, Fraser,
  Colombia, San Joaquin, Sacramento, and Colorado, entering the Pacific.
  The rivers which flow into the Pacific, however, owing to the fact that
  the great backbone of the continent, the Rocky Mountains and the Andes,
  lies so near the west coast, are of comparatively little importance, in
  S. America being all quite small. Sometimes rivers traversing the same
  plains, and nearly on the same levels, open communications with each
  other, a remarkable instance being the Cassiquiari in S. America, which,
  branching off from the Rio Negro and joining the Orinoco, forms a kind of
  natural canal, uniting the basins of the Orinoco and the Amazon. The
  Amazon or Marañon in S. America, the largest river in the world, has a
  course of about 3500 miles, and a basin of 2,300,000 sq. miles; the
  Mississippi-Missouri, the largest river of North America, runs a longer
  course than the Amazon, but the area of its basin is not nearly so great.
  North America has the most extensive group of lakes in the
  world&mdash;Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, which
  through the St. Lawrence send their drainage to the Atlantic. Thus by
  means of lakes and rivers the interior of both N. and S. America is
  opened up and made accessible.</p>

  <p>In regard to climate N. America naturally differs very much from S.
  America, and has more resemblance to the continents of Europe and Asia
  (regarded as a whole). In N. America, as in the older continent, the
  eastern parts are colder than the western, and hence the towns on the
  Atlantic coast have a winter temperature about 10° lower than those in
  corresponding latitudes of Europe. The winter temperature of the greater
  part of N. America is indeed severe, though the intense cold is less felt
  on account of the dryness of the air. There is no regular season of
  rainfall unless in the south. Although two-thirds of S. America lies
  within the tropics the heat is not so great as might be expected, owing
  to the prevailing winds, the influences of the Andes, and other causes.
  The highest temperature experienced is probably not more than 100° in the
  shade; at Rio de Janeiro the mean is about 74°, at Lima 72°. Over a great
  part of S. America there is a wet and a dry season, varying in different
  regions; on the upper Amazon the rains last for ten months, being caused
  by the prevailing easterly winds bringing moisture from the Atlantic,
  which is condensed on the eastern slopes of the Andes. In each of the
  Americas there is a region in which little or no rain falls; in N.
  America it extends over a part of the United States and Northern Mexico,
  in S. America over a part of the coast region of Peru and Chile.</p>

  <p>America is rich in valuable minerals. It has supplied the world with
  immense quantities of gold and silver, which it still yields in no small
  amount, especially in the United States. It possesses inexhaustible
  stores of coal (United States), with iron, copper, lead, tin, mercury,
  &amp;c. Petroleum may be called one of its specialities, its petroleum
  wells having caused whole towns to spring into existence. Diamonds and
  other precious stones are found.</p>

  <p>As regards vegetation America may be called a region of forests and
  verdure, vast tracts being covered by the grassy prairies, llanos, and
  pampas where the forests fail. In N. America the forests have been
  largely made use of by man; in S. America vast areas are covered with
  forests, which as yet are traversed only by the uncivilized Indian. In
  the north is the region of pines and firs; farther south come the
  deciduous trees, as the oak, beech, maple, elm, chestnut, &amp;c. Then
  follow the evergreen forests of the tropical regions. The useful timber
  trees are very numerous; among the most characteristic of America are
  mahogany and other ornamental woods, and various dyewoods. In the
  tropical parts are numerous palms, cacti in great variety, and various
  species of the agave or American aloe. In the virgin forests of S.
  America the trees are <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page140"></a>[140]</span>often bound together into an impenetrable
  mass of vegetation by various kinds of climbing and twining plants. Among
  useful plants belonging to the American continent are maize, the potato,
  cacao, tobacco, cinchona, vanilla, Paraguay tea, &amp;c. The most
  important plants introduced are wheat, rice, and other grains,
  sugar-cane, coffee, and cotton, with various fruits and vegetables. The
  vine is native to the continent, and both the American and introduced
  varieties are now largely cultivated.</p>

  <p>The animals of America include, among carnivora, the jaguar or
  American tiger, found only in S. America; the puma or American lion,
  found mostly in S. America; the grizzly bear of N. America, fully as
  powerful an animal as either; the black bear, the skunk, the racoon, the
  American or prairie wolf, several species of foxes, &amp;c. The rodents
  are represented by the beaver, the porcupine, and squirrels of several
  species; the marsupials by the opossum. Among ruminants are the bison,
  or, as it is commonly called, the buffalo, the moose or elk, the
  Virginian stag, the musk-ox; and in S. America the llama (which takes the
  place of the camel of the Old World), the alpaca, and the vicuña. Other
  animals most distinctive of S. America are sloths, fitted to live only in
  its dense and boundless forests; ant-eaters and armadillos; monkeys with
  prehensile tails, in this and other respects differing from those of the
  Old World; the condor among the heights of the Andes, the nandu, rhea or
  three-toed ostrich, beautiful parrots and humming-birds. Among American
  reptiles are the boa-constrictor, the rattlesnake, the alligator or
  cayman, the iguana and other large lizards, large frogs and toads. The
  domestic animals of America, horses, cattle, and sheep, are of foreign
  origin. The electrical eel exists in the tropical waters.</p>

  <p>The population of America consists partly of an aboriginal race or
  races, partly of immigrants or their descendants. The aboriginal
  inhabitants are the American Indians or red men, being generally of a
  brownish-red colour, and now forming a very small portion of the total
  population, especially in N. America, where the white population has
  almost exterminated them. These people are divided into branches, some of
  which have displayed a considerable aptitude for civilization. When the
  Europeans became acquainted with the New World, Mexico, Central America,
  and part of S. America were inhabited by populations which had made great
  advances in many things that pertain to civilized life, dwelling in large
  and well-built cities under a settled form of government, and practising
  agriculture and the mechanical arts. Ever since the discovery of America
  at the close of the fifteenth century Europeans of all nations have
  crowded into it; and the comparatively feeble native races have rapidly
  diminished, or lost their distinctive features by intermixtures with
  whites, and also with negroes brought from Africa to work as slaves.
  These mixed races are distinguished by a variety of names, as Mestizos,
  Mulattoes, Zambos, &amp;c. In North America the white population is
  mainly of British origin, though to a considerable extent it also
  consists of Germans, Scandinavians, &amp;c., and the descendants of such.
  In Central and South America the prevailing white nationality is the
  Spanish and Portuguese. In the extreme north are the Eskimos&mdash;a
  scattered and stunted race closely allied to some of the peoples of
  Northern Asia. That the aboriginal inhabitants of America passed over
  from Asia is tolerably certain, but when and from what part we do not
  know. The total population of the New World is estimated at 180,000,000,
  of which perhaps 124,000,000 are whites, 28,000,000 mixed races,
  15,000,000 negroes, and 13,000,000 Indians. As regards religion, the bulk
  of the population of N. America is Protestant; of Central and S. America
  the religion is almost exclusively Roman Catholic. Several millions of
  the Indians are heathens.&mdash;The independent States of America are all
  republican in form of government, Brazil having become a republic in
  1889. See <i>North America</i>, <i>Central America</i>, <i>South
  America</i>, <i>West Indies</i>, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The merit of first opening up the American continent to modern Europe
  belongs to the Genoese navigator Christopher Columbus, who discovered, in
  Oct., 1492, one of the Bahamas, and named it San Salvador. Europeans,
  however, had on different former occasions discovered the American
  coasts, and the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island were visited by
  Northmen and named Vinland in the year 1000. Still these discoveries had
  no influence on the enterprise of Columbus, and cannot detract in the
  least from his merit; they were forgotten, and had never been made known
  to the inhabitants of the rest of Europe. Though Columbus was the first
  of his time who set foot in the New World, it has taken its name not from
  him, but from Amerigo Vespucci. The mainland was first seen in 1497 by
  Sebastian Cabot, who sailed under the patronage of Henry VII of England.
  For further particulars of discovery see <i>North America</i> and
  <i>South America</i>.</p>

  <p>The known history of America hardly goes beyond the period of its
  discovery by Columbus; but it possesses many monuments of antiquity that
  might take us many centuries backward, could we learn anything of their
  origin or of those by whom they were produced. Among such antiquities are
  great earthworks in the form of mounds, or of raised enclosures, crowning
  the tops of hills, river peninsulas, &amp;c., and no doubt serving for
  defence. They enclose considerable <!-- Page 141 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>[141]</span>areas, are surrounded
  by an exterior ditch, and by ramparts which are composed of mingled earth
  and stones, and are often of great extent in proportion to the area
  enclosed. They are always supplied either naturally or artificially with
  water, and give other indications of having been provided for a siege.
  Barrows and tumuli containing human bones, and bearing indications of
  having been used both as places of sepulture and as temples, are also
  numerous. They are in geometrical forms&mdash;circles, squares,
  parallelograms, &amp;c. A mound on the plain of Cahokia in Illinois,
  opposite the city of St. Louis, is 700 feet long, 500 feet broad, and 90
  feet high. Earth mounds of another class represent gigantic animal forms
  in bas-relief on the ground. One is a man with two heads, the body 50
  feet long and 25 feet broad across the breast; another represents a
  serpent 1000 feet in length, with graceful curves. The monuments of
  Mexico, Central America, and Peru are of a more advanced state of
  civilization, approach nearer to the historical period, and make the loss
  of authentic information more keenly felt. Here there are numerous ruined
  towns with most elaborate sculptures, lofty pyramidal structures serving
  as temples or forts, statues, picture writing, hieroglyphics, roads,
  aqueducts, bridges, &amp;c. Some remarkable prehistoric remains
  discovered in recent years are what are known as the abodes of the
  'cliff-dwellers'. These consist of habitations constructed on terraces
  and in caves high up and steep sides of cañons in Colorado and other
  parts of the western states of N. America. Some of these buildings are
  several stories high. See also <i>Mexico</i>, <i>Peru</i>,
